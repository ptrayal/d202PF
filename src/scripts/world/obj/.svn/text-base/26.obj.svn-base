arcane~
Arcane Spellcasters

Arcane Spellcasters are different than divine spellcasters in that they
receive their spells from the magical weave that permeates all of Krynn.
Some receive this through the medium of the deities of magic, wizards for
example, while others receive their abilities by tapping directly into
gthe magical weave itself through natural talents, such as sorcerers
and bards.

Wizards are special in that they require the use of spellbooks to maintain
a list of the spells which the can memorize and cast.  More information can
be found on that in one of the following sections.
Sorcerers are able to know a set number of spells which they can change when
they level, and bards can choose from a set spell list that does not change.

Another special limitation of arcane spellcasters is that they suffer
a chance to fail spells when they cast them in armor.  The heavier the
armor the greater the chance of spell failure.  Bards have the ability
to cast spells without chance of spell failure in light armor and can
extend this to medium armor with the battle caster feat.  Also Knights
of the Thorn obtain the ability to lower the spell failure chance when
casting in armor as they achieve higher levels.

divine religion domains devote~
Religion, Devotion and Domains

In the world of Krynn, everyone must devote themselves to one of 
the pantheon of dieties, normally of their own race, but not always 
as a requirement. The people of Krynn take their religion quite 
seriously, and virtually every sentient creature on the planet 
worships at least one deity.  For divine spellcasters, this is even 
more important, for they can cast no spells without a patron deity.  

In order to choose a deity, type devote <deity name>.  To see a list 
of deities which you qualify to be accepted as a worshipper, type 
'devote list'.  At any time during the life of your character you may 
change your deity by typing devote <new deity name> yes.  
You will have to meet the requirements of the deity's race and/or 
alignment and/or class and you will also suffer a penalty to experience 
for a time until you have fully converted to your new faith.  

The first faith you choose will never cause an exp penalty.  If you are
a cleric you may choose up to two domains of the (up to) four that your deity 
possess. These domains will grant you bonus spells and bonus abilities 
(in most cases). To see a list of domains your deity offers type 'domain'.  
If you have not yet devoted to a deity, the game will, at this point, 
direct you to do so.  To see what benefits a domain offers, type 'help domain 
<domain name>'.  Once you have chosen your two domains, you can see what they 
are at any time by typing 'domain' by itself.  

Dieties of Good: Paladine(*), Mishakal, Habbakuk, Majere, Kiri-Jolith, Solinari, Branchala
Dieites of Nutrality: Chislev, Reorx, Sirrion, Zivilyn, Lunitari, Shinari
Dieties of Evil: Takhisis(**), Sargonnas, Zeboim, Chemosh, Morgion, Nuitari

Dieties of Nature: Chislev, Habbakuk, Zivilyn, Zeboim
Dieties of Magic: Solinari, Lunitari, Nuitari

(*) Paladine gave up his godhood in the War of the Souls in order to free Krynn from
its fate, trapped by Takhisis.  He wanders the world as a mortal, though many still
pay him homage.  His domains have been taken up by Kiri-Jolith, though the new
patron of good allows mortals to worship him in Paladine's name.  Thus Paladine may
still be chosen as a deity, even though in reality the divine power is provided by
Kiri-Jolith.

(**) Takhisis was killed during the War of the Souls.  Paladine gave up his immortality
so that Takhisis would lose hers, and thus be able to be killed.  Sargonnas has taken
up the Dragon Queen's domains in an attempt to retain her followers under his banner.
There is little doubt among Takhisis' followers that their Queen is dead, however they
grudgingly accept Sargonnas' assistance as they continue following the mandates of
their past religion.  Of course there is always a twinge of Sargonnas' personality in
their divine orders, but Sargonnas does at least allow them to worship him in Takhisis'
name in order to keep them on as followers and not lose them to another deity of darkness.

spellcasting~
Magic and the Spellcasting System

The magic system here is comprised of a memorization system, and 
thus mana points are not used.  In most cases you have to select 
beforehand the spells that you want to have available, and then 
rest for a 2-5 minutes while your character prepares them for 
casting.  There are a few basic commands that must be learned in 
order to play a spellcasting class effectively.  
First is the cast command.  Second is the mem command, and third 
is the spells command.  

Wizards also require spellbooks, libraries and scrolls to operate 
properly.

Spellcasting is a relatively simple process though the use of aliases, 
either using the in-game alias command or by using a mud client, both of 
which are described later, makes it much, much, easier.  See help alias 
to set aliases.

The cast command is used to cast a spell and contains the syntax cast 
'<spell name>' <target keyword>.   Note that the spell name is encolsed 
in quotation marks.  

In order to cast the magic missile spell at a goblin I would type 'cast 
'magic missile' goblin'.  If I was already fighting that goblin, I would 
only need to type 'cast 'magic missile'.  If I was fighting two goblins, 
and I wanted to cast the spell on the second I would type 'cast 'magic 
missile' 2.goblin'. 

Non-aggresive spells work similarly.  If I wanted to cast mage armor on 
myself I would only need to type 'cast 'mage armor''.  If I wanted to cast
the spell on a nearby elf I would type 'cast 'mage armor' elf'.  As a side 
note, you can always target yourself by using the keyword me.  For example 
'cast 'mage armor' me'.  Go four rooms west to learn about researching 
spells and libraries.
~
E
spell-list~
Reviewing Your Spell List

The first step to using your magical aptitude is to see what 
you can actually cast.  The spells command comes in here.  It's
basic use is simple.  You type 'spells' and you are given a list
of what spells are available to you to cast, unless you are a 
wizard, in which case you need to look at your spellbook(s) to 
see what spells you have.  The spells command will only list the 
spells that are available to you to memorize or learn in the case
of wizards.  As you gain levels in spellcasting classes, your spell
list will widen.  You will need to change your active class in order
to see spells for different spellcasting classes.

This can be done by using the setactive command.  Type setactive
and it will list your classes.  Then type setactive and the number
beside the class you wish to change to, and it will change your
active class.  This mainly comes in use with spell memorization and
other spellcasting class utilities.
~
E
memorizing~
Preparing Spells for Casting By Memorizing Them

In order to cast a spell, you must first memorize it.  In the 
future bards and sorcerers will be added who can cast any spell 
that they know at any time, assuming they have spell slots left.  
Clerics and druids will also be able to spontaneously cast certain
spells as well, though this feature is not currently implemented.  
The syntax for memorizing a spell is simple: memorize <spellname>. 
So if the magic missile spell was available to me I would memorize 
it by typing 'mem magic missile'.  

As a caster you will most likely want to use automem most of the time.
This option automatically starts memorizing a spell after you cast it 
and can be turned on simply by typing 'automem'.  

If you are memorizing a spell and want to stop memorizing it, type stop
<spell name>.  If you have a spell memorized already and want to replace
it with something else, type forget <spell name>.  

If you cleric, paladin, ranger or druid you will need to have a holy 
symbol item in order to cast spells.  All spellcasting classes start 
with a holy symbol item but they can also be bought at the various shops
throughout the game.
~
E
levelling multiclassing~
The Gain Command and Multi-Classing

In order to gain a level in your current class, or another you must use
the gain command.  This command is used by typing gain <name of class 
you wish to gain a level in>.  

A character may always gain any number of levels in any of the basic 
classes (see help classes basic), and may also gain additional levels
in any of the prestige classes that they qualify for (see help classes
prestige).  A person may find out what classes they qualify for by 
typing the gain command without any arguments, like this: 'gain'.  If
a class is not listed there, you may find out what requisites you are 
missing by attempting to gain a level in that class, and by typing gain
<class name>.  You will be notified when you are able to gain a level 
by a yellow message when you gain experience.   However if you qualify 
for a milestone you have not yet taken, this message may not show.  It
will display that you have achieved 100% of your experience required for
the next level in your score (type score).  
When you actually gain a level you will receive a text flow that will 
describe what you attained that level in hit points, skill points, feats,
class abilities and so on.  

You may have any number of classes at any given time, and any number of
combinations of levels up to a total level cap, currently, of 100, which
for all intents and purposes is unattainable without the proper zone 
support.  Each race has a favored class, and this class does not count
towards multi-class penalties.  To prevent min-maxxing however we have made
it so that you must have a minimum of 5 levels i each class you have before
you can take a new one.

What is a multi-class penalty?  Well if you have more than 1 basic class, 
not including your races favored class (prestige classes don't count toward
this as well) then you suffer a permanent -10% to experience for every 
class beyond the first to a maximum of -50%.
~
E
abilities milestones~
Training Ability Scores and Obtaining Milestones

Every 4 levels you achieve in total (all of your classes combined)
you receive one ability score training point.  This is used by the
train command and is very simple.  If you wish to increase your 
strength by one you would type 'train strength'.  If it was your 
wisdom, 'train wisdom'. 

Milestones are a little extra to take out the tedium of levelling
at higher levels, though they are available right from the 
beginning. Every time you achieve a 20% mark of your exp required
for the next level you receive a milestone bonus that you can 
receive at your trainer.  So if you need 1000 exp for level 2, 
you will receive a milestone at 200 exp, 400 exp, 600 exp, 800 
exp, and then your full level at 1000 exp.  

To gain a milestone simply type gain <class name>.  For example 
if I was a fighter I would type 'gain fighter' and this would 
grant me my milestone. 

Milestone rewards can be anything from some free gold, to an 
extra hp or two, to a skill point or even an extra feat or 
ability score training point.  Milestones are one of the few 
things that are never reimbursed in any circumstance.  

If for whatever reason you ever have to remake or respec your 
character your milestone rewards will not be reimbursed, you 
will have to take what you get during the process of levelling 
your character again with the exp that is reimbursed to you.  To 
learn about levelling up in general please go north.  
~
E
skills~

To see your skills type practice or prac for short.  Your skills are seperated
into class skills which are highlighted in green  and cross-class skills which
are white.  Each skill has an ability score tied to it, and this value is added
to the skill.  Some skills can be used without actually buying and ranks in
them, such as hide, though others must have at least one rank to be able to use
it, such as open lock.  You can find out what skills do by reading their help
file, usually help skill <skill name> as in 'help skill tumble' or by check the
per skill rank, a 1:1 ratio.  Their maximum value is always your level + 3.
Cross-class skills can be purchased for 2 skill points per rank, a 2:1 ratio.
Their maximum value is always your (level / 2) + 1.  This maximum value applies
only to purchased ranks.

Some skills can be used without actually buying and ranks in them, such as hide,
though others must have at least one rank to be able to use it, such as open
lock.

In order to learn  a skill simply type practice <skill name> for example
'practice tumble'.  Each time  you type this you will buy one rank in this skill
assuming you have enough skill points, you are at a trainer who can and will
teach the skill to you, and you are not already at your maximum value for that
skill at your level.  Once you are done training in your skills go north to read
about ability score trains and milestones.
~
E
feats~

The first thing you must do in order to choose feats is see what is available 
and see what you already have.  To see what you already have type 'feats known'.
To see what you qualify for to choose type 'feats available'.  In both lists you
will see the names of various feats. 

For help on a specific feat the help command is generally feat <name of feat> 
for example 'help feat toughness'.  In the event that there is no or 
insufficient help on a feat feel free to look the feat up on http://d20srd.org/. 

Once you have decided to choose a feat type learn <featname> for example 'learn 
toughness'.  If you want to  learn a feat with a specific subset, you need to 
seperate the general feat name and the specific subset you wish to specialize in
with a colon and no spaces.   For example, skill focus can be specialized in the
tumble skill and the syntax  would be: 
'learn skill focus:tumble'.
~
E
training~
One of the first things you will want to do is to train your character.  Every time
that your character gains a level, he will attain hit points, move points, skill 
points and depending on his class and level, new spell slots, feats, and class 
abilities.  We will focus first on feats.  

Every character starts off with at least 1 feat, and possibly more depending on 
class and race.  A feat is a character trait that either grants your character 
a new ability or improves an already existing one.  

Characters automatically start with one and gain one every 3 levels.  Some 
classes offer bonus feats to choose from a seperate list and at epic levels all 
classes offer bonus feats.  

Epic levels begin at level 21, and enable the ability to obtain even more 
powerful feats.  

Skill points are granted based on class and intelligence.  Humans also get an 
extra skill point each level and 4 more at level 1.  Skill points are used to 
increase the skills your character has.  Some of these skills grant new 
character abilities and powers while others are used passively to enhance your 
character in certain situations.  

The biggest difference between a feat and a skill is that, in general, skills 
have a rating, while feats are simply either you have it or you don't.  Also of 
note are your ability scores.  

Every 4 levels you obtain an ability score point that you can add to any of your
ability scores you desire (ie.  Strength, Dexterity, etc.  ). 
To train you may find Gage, who is the in the training pits of the adventurer's
academy.  From the mud school entrance go south, east, north, east and down.
Gage can train you in every skill and feat, though eventually you will have to find
a trainer more specific to the abilities you want to learn, as Gage only trains
up to level 10.

E
libraries research~
Researching Spells and Libraries

The room you are in is a spell researching library.  There are three types 
of spell research libraries, small, medium and large.  Small libraries have 
up to level 3 spells, medium to 6 and large up to 9.  
Note:Epic spells are gained as feats. 

By using the research command in these libraries you are able to learn new 
spells, either by spending spell research points, which wizards gain two of 
each level, or by spending coin.  As a new character you will start with a 
spellbook with all the cantrips already in it and a few first level spells.   
Take a moment to 'look spellbook' now to see what spells you already have.   
Take note that your spellbook has a certain number of pages.  The number 
beside each spell is the number of pages it occupies.  Higher level mages 
will need to carry with them multiple spellbooks.  

When a mage wants to research a new spell in a library, they must use the 
research command by typing research <spell name>.  For example 'research 
chill touch'.  Notice that I did not use the quotes around  the spell name.  
If the mage has any available spell research tokens, success is automatic 
and one token is taken from the character.  These tokens are intangible and 
are stored in your character file.  

You can see how many you have at any given time by typing 'stat'.  If you 
have no tokens you can attempt to research a spell by paying in coins.  
The cost of the research depends on the spell level.  When researching by 
paying, success is not automatic.  It is an ability check with your 
intelligence modifier against the level of the spell.  

If you have an intelligence of 18 and are trying to learn a level 5 spell, 
the roll would be 1d20 + 4 (your modifier) against 10 (base difficulty) + 5 
(spell level).  If your roll is higher than than the difficulty class (or 
dc, 15 in this case) then you learn the spell and scribe it into your 
spellbook assuming you have space.  Otherwise you fail and must pay 20% of 
the research fee in wasted resources.  
~
E
spellbooks scribe~
Scribing Spells Into Your Spellbook

Wizards automatically have the ability to scribe magical scrolls into their 
spellbook.  First the wizard must have a spellbook in their inventory with 
enough free pages in it to fit the spell.  Second he must have the spell 
memorized that they wish to scribe.  This spell must also be a spell that 
he is able to learn.  Thus it must be an arcane spell of a spell level that 
the wizard can cast normally.  With these requisites satisfied, the wizard 
simply need type scribe <spellbook keyword> <name of memorized spell>.
If I wanted to scribe a scroll containing the chill touch spell into my 
spellbook, I would first memorize the spell from the scroll, and then I 
would type 'scribe spellbook chill touch'.  The spell would go into the
first spellbook in my inventory that has room for it.  

This command can also be used to create scrolls.  Simply replace <spellbook 
keyword> with <scroll keyword>.  If I wanted to copy chill touch from my 
spellbook onto a blank scroll I would first memorize the spell from the 
spell book, and then I would type 'scribe scroll chill touch' and the spell 
would be scribed onto the scroll which could then use to cast the spell 
on-the-fly or sell to another wizard for him to memorize and scribe into 
his spellbook.
