though there is a price associated with spell research, unless of course your

here by typing @Yresearch <spellname>@n for example research lightning bolt.

  In this area of the host tower guests and wizards alike may employ
the services of the brotherhood to enchant their items.  There is,
of course, a cost associated with enchanting, and powerful enchantments
can cost great amounts of gold.  Please be aware of your item's current
enchantments as it is possible to replace an item's enchantments with
weaker enchantments of the same kind.

To see how much an enchantment would cost, type @Yvalue <item> <enchantment>
<modifier>@n.  For example value club ac-natural 20 would see how much
an enchantment would cost on the person's club for +20 to natural armor
value.

To enchant the item, type @Yenchant <item> <enchantment> <modifier>@n.  For
example, enchant club ac-natural 20 would enchant the person's club with
a +20 bonus to natural armor.

To see what you can enchant type @Yvalue <item>@n and it will list
the possible enchantments.
