   This man is not large, niether small, and overall appears rather easy to give
a once over and forget about entirely.  He wears red robes, and carries in his
hands a rather common looking staff and a sling as his belt.  His free hand
rests against a thin onyx tablet on the table.  Enscribed in a flowing font on
the tablet, engraven right into the stone are several names with accompanying
details, apparently a list of occupants in the camp.
