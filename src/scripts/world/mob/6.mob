zombie humanoid mob~
a humanoid zombie~
A humanoid zombie wanders the ruins mindlessly.
~
   There is not much to this zombie, aside from decayed and, in some parts,
half-eaten flesh.  It's hair comes down in long whisps and its eyes have long
ago disappeared as the meal to some crawling creature.  It wears tattered
leathers covered in earth and dirt and wields in its hand a large club.

wraith dark shrouded mob~
a dark, shrouded wraith~
Shrouded in darkness is the wraith of a academy professor floating menacingly nearby.
~
   Barely recognisable as once being human, this wrath is shrouded in darkness
and choking mist.  Through the foreboding haze can be seen the image of robes
though the spectral face of the undead horror is twisted in eternal torment and
the hatred for all who live without it.

priest undead mob~
an undead priest of Cyric~
The "revived" corpse of a priest of Cyric is here sustaining the undead army.
~
   Clad completely in black robes and wearing a white skull mask, this priest
most definitely serves the Lord of Death, Cyric.  He is humanoid and from the
rotting grey skin that does show, he has obvious accepted Cyric's "gift of
eternal life".  He stands at the side of a cloth covered altar chanting in low
gutteral tones, and though he appears to be aware of your presence he makes no
move towards you.
