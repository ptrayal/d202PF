Renthilos~
Renthilos, a crimson robed mage stares you up and down inquisitively.
~
   Renthilos appears to be of elven descent, but does stand a bit tall for an
elf.  He is clad in a dark crimson robe, depicting his standing of balance and
neutrality in his ways of magic.  He stares at you somewhat rudely, and seems a
little suprised.

a lesser clay golem~
A clay golem wanders about the training pits without purpose.
~
   This golem has been sculpted of clay, and closely resembles a human.  The
clay has of course hardened to a degree, making the golem almost rock-like in
design.  The golem doesn't seem to be paying any attention to you, and just
endlessly meanders about the complex, awaiting it's turn to be destroyed, only
to be rebuilt and animated once more.

descent.  The wood looks to be somewhat new, although may gashes and slashes lie
upon the face of it.  The golem doesn't seem to be paying any attention to you,

something of dwarven heritage, but it is difficult to tell.  The golem does
appear to be rather ominous though, and even a little eerie looking.  The golem
doesn't seem to be paying any attention to you, and just endlessly meanders
about the complex, awaiting it's turn to be destroyed, only to be rebuilt and

adventurers.  The success rate of travelers in the training pit is quite high,
however the few that do meet their ill-fate within the pits are made use of.  
The golem doesn't seem to be paying any attention to you, and just endlessly
meanders about the complex with a great look of sadness upon it's morbid face,
awaiting it's turn to be destroyed once again, only to be rebuilt and
reanimated.

over time have began to rust slightly, and the least little move the golem makes
causes horrible creaking noises.  The golem doesn't seem to be paying any

   So nearly transparent that they are difficult to see, these cubes travel down
dungeon corridors, absorbing carrion and trash along the way.  Their sides
glisten, tending to leave a slimy trail, but gelatinous cubes cannot climb walls
or cling to ceilings.

being able to slip through cracks and holes as small as a rat hole.  They move
completely silently across all surfaces, simply oozing slowly over all bumps and
turns.

A young carrion crawler is here, tunneling through soft portions of the ground.
~
   The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding primarily
upon carrion.  When such food becomes scarce, however, it will attack and kill
living creatures.  The crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm
and a cephalopod.  Like so many other hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may
well be the result of genetic experimentation by a mad, evil wizard.

An inexperienced adventurer is here, seeking out opponents to train against.

   This young man is scrawny at best, and appears to be far too clumsy to be a
threat to anyone, or anything for that matter.  He has dark, sandy-blonde hair
that continually falls down in front of his eyes, therefore blinding him, making
him even less effective in fighting than he already was.  Noticing your
inquisitive stare, he puffs out his chest as if to make him look more
intimidating.
