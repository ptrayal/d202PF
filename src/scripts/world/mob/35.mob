sanitation sewer cleaner man~
a Luskan sewer cleaner~
A man is here picking up excess waste to prevent backups in the sewers.
~
This man is dressed in a suit that covers his entire body.  Heavy gloves cover
his hands, preventing him from making any real contact with whatever disgusting
things he may be picking up in the sewers.  In his hand he carries a sharp,
pointy stick for stabbing both rats and garbage as he makes his rounds.  Across
his back is slung a large pack in which he carries his gross cargo.
