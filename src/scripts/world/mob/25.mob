Aliesha Wytheriit, the Solace adventurer's guild greeter can be seen through the building window.

   This woman is garbed in white robes and wears a silver-colored sash with blue
heraldry across her front.  Emblazoned on the sash are the words "Solace
Adventurer's Guild".  She is positioned within the small round building, with
her head visible from the window.  As she notices you she nods her head and
beckons you forward to answer any questions you might have.
