The Hall of Judgement~
   You step forth from beyond the veil and into the realm of Kelemvor.  You are
neither dead nor alive, and your presence here at the Hall of Judgement, given
that fact, means that you must go forth into the Realms, and leave this place of
stasis.  A ghostly being, a herald of some sort, urges you north through a set
of black, wrought-iron gates.  A voice speaks to your mind telling you to use
the @Ynewbie@n command if you need any help at any time.  If you are completely
new to muds please go east by typing @Yeast@n to begin the beginners lessons.

Choose Your Race~
   Since all beings are created with a gender, you are urged by Kelemvor's
servants here to select the race you would choose for your being during your
life on Toril.  It is said that the Gods allow some stalwart followers of their
to reincarnate as advanced races, and if you are one of these lucky fellows you
may ask any deity in the heavens above to change your race now, if indeed there
are any available for such a task.  However, if you are like most souls coming
through these gates, you must choose a common race.  But be not vexed for this,
as the common races, though plentiful, are as rich in culture and are by no
means left aside in the realm of ability either.  The ghostly servant escorting
you through your journey of creation explains to you that you may receive a
message to your mind of what races are avaialble through the @Ylistraces@n
command.  Once you are ready to choose a race, you simply must use the
@Ysetrace@n command followed by the name of the race you wish to become.  For
example: setrace icefolk barbarian.  This would set your race to that of the
icefolk barbarians common in the far reaches of the North such as Icewind Dale.
When you have chosen your race simply go north to continue your creation.  If
you need more information on a race, please use @Yhelp @Yrace @Y<racename>@n.

Choose Your Alignment~
   Here Kelemvor's servants urge you to select an alignment.  This should be an
easy choice for most spirits, as they each have their own personalities from the
beginning.  However each spirit has the choice to alter that personality before
they are born on Faerun.  TO change your alignment you may use @Ysetalign@n
<alignment>.  Your alignment is one of good, neutral or evil.  To set your
ethos, use @Ysetethos@n <ethos> Your ethos is one of lawful, nuetral or chaotic.
Your full alignment is your ethos followed by your alignment.  So lawful good
for example.  Your alignment will determine what equipment you can use, what
classes you can choose, and other aspects of being in the world of Faerun.  You
are urged to go north once you have chosen your alignment and ethos.

Choose Your Ability Scores~
   You are urged into this area by Kelemvor's servants to set your ability
scores.  You can do this by using the @Ysetstats@n command.  The proper syntax
is @Ysetstats @Y<ability @Yscore> @Y<new @Yscore>@n or @Ysetstats @Yshow@n to
display your stats.  For example, @Ysetstats @Ystrength @Y16@n would set your
strength to 16 if you had enough points to buy that score.  You start off with
20 stat points to assign, and the higher the stat the more points it costs.  
The available ability scores are strength, dexterity, constitution,
intelligence, wisdom and charisma.  Type @Yhelp @Yability @Yscore @Y<name>@n for
more information on each ability score.

Choose Your Description~
   The servants of Kelemvor urge you here to describe your physical form.  You
may do this by using @Ysetdescs@n.  This will take you to a menu where you can
choose the various descriptors for your character.  If you do not see a
descriptor that you would like to have, please tell a God and it will be added
for you to choose later.

Beginner's Lesson 1 - Directional Movement~
   To move around the mud you must type the name of the direction you want to
go.  You may see which directions are available by typing exits, or if you have
autoexits enabled it will display the exits in the room automatically when you
look or move.  The automap and map commands as well can help to see where things
are.  On the map you are in the room with the exclamation mark (!  ).  Go east
to continue ro go down to test out moving in different directions.

Beginner's Lesson 2 - Looking~
   You wil undoubtedly want to get greater detail on things throughout the game,
and one of the ways you can do this is by looking at them.  To look in the room
you are in simply type @Ylook@n.  To look at another player or a monster
(otherwise known as mob) type @Ylook @Y<name @Yor @Ydescription>@n To look at an
object type @Ylook @Y<object @Ydescription @Ykeyword>@n.  You can test this out
by typing @Ylook@n, @Ylook @Yself@n, and @Ylook @Ymap@n to look at the map in
your inventory.

Beginner's Lesson 3 - Doors~
   Sometimes exits are blocked with a door of some kind whether it be an actual
door, a sewer manhole, a gate, or what have you.  In order to open it, you must
type @Yopen @Y<door @Ykeyword>@n.  If it is locked and you have the key, you can
unlock it using the @Yunlock @Y<door @Ykeyword>@n command.  If you have the pick
locks skill practiced, you can pick the lock by typing @Ypick @Y<door
@Ykeyword>@n.  Sometimes exits are hidden and you are able to find them by using
the @Ysearch @Y<direction>@N command.  @n

Beginner's Lesson 4 - Containers~
   You will often interact with containers such as bags and backpacks throughout
the game.  In order to get something from the container, whether it be a bag or
a corpse of the mob you just killed, you will need to type @Yget @Y<item
@Ykeyword> @Y<container @Ykeyword>@n.  For example, get coins corpse.  You can
also get all items from a container by typing @Yget @Yall @Y<container
@Ykeyword>@n.  If you want to put something in a container type @Yput @Y<item
@Ykeyword> @Y<container @Ykeyword>@n, and just like get, you can use the all
keyword in place of the item keyword to put everything in your inventory into a
container.  You can see what is typeing @Yinventory@n or just @Yi@n@N for short.
