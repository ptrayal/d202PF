A Trail Lined with Flowers~
   Tall yellow flowers line both sides of this trail.  They appear wilted and
nearly dead.  A silence hangs over the air, as if the entire plains had suddenly
emptied of life.

Near Some Leafless Trees~
   You stand near some short, stumpy leafless trees.  The bark appears to be
peeling off of most of them, and sap oozes from dark ruptures in the wood of the
trees.  The howling wind sets the trees to rustling.

Within the Leafless Trees~
   Leafless trees surround you, shifting in the chill wind.  To the south, a
mud-walled building stands at the end of the trail.  A bird lies dead at your
feet, with no apparent cause of death.

Near the Mud-Walled Temple~
   You stand a few steps from the door of the mud-walled building.  Various
markings have been carved above and around the door.  They look like symbols of
Silvanus, the Breath of Life, but they have been twisted and warped into new,
horrible shapes.  A single figure stands nearly obscured in the shadows near the
door.  Though you can not be sure, you think it is looking in your direction.

   The door to the mud-walled temple stands just before you, beckoning you with
its warped symbols of Silvanus.  Upon the door is a finely crafted brass handle
with a lock which appears to be made of the same type of brass as the door.  
The deathly silence of the area is almost astounding.

run, turning south after a short distance.

A Hall Between the Cells~
   This wide hall travels between the rows of cells.  Thick metal cell doors
stand between you and the inside of each cell.  The doors themselves look solid
and well maintained.  The damp air is thick with torch smoke and the smell of
unwashed prisoners.

A Holding Cell~
   This small holding cell is damp and has a foul stench.  A bench juts out from
the wall, and doubles as a bed.  Old hay lies scattered across the floor, but
mostly only mud is visible.  A thin trickle of water pours in from a rusty pipe,
collecting in a small pool before draining to Gilean knows where.

Entrance to an Underground Garden~
   This small path has a musty smell to it.  To the east, covered in a misty
fog, a small garden has been set up underground.  The druids of this temple must
have strange magic to allow plants to grow without the aid of sunlight.

An Underground Garden~
   As you step into the garden, the environment changes to appear as if you were
standing outside.  A ceiling is above you, but you can see the sky clearly also.
The garden is a simple path that leads around a large tree at its center.

The Garden Path~
   The path moves around the edge of the small garden that is grown underground.
There are small flowers along each edge of the path, but it seems unwise to
smell them.  The path is composed of dirt, but it is perfectly smooth and the
dirt does not move onto your boots or clothing.

A Solitary Tree~
   A large, solitary tree rests in the center of this small clearing of
vegetation.  The tree has bark that is pitch black, and seems to hum with a soft
murmur.  The leaves of the tree are a dark green color, and seem to drip with a
strange sap.

An Altar to Silvanus~
   An altar has been erected here to the god of wisdom, Silvanus.  Incense is
being burned in jars around the edge of the altar, and a small tree rests in its
center.  A footstool rests in front of it, where druids come and pray for spells
and good growth.
