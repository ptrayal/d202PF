Outside the Outpost Gates~
   You stand outside the Earth Cultist's outpost main gates.  The complex resembles a
military camp more than it does a place of worship.  A long wall runs east and
west, made of wooden poles and fortified heavily.  Small towers have been made
where most liekly archers reside.  The gates are wooden also and look as if
they're require a horse or something to open.  A small door in the right gate
allows easier passage through.

Beneath the Wooden Ramparts~
   The ground here is hard packed from the constant traffic of worshippers going
to the temple to the north.  Ahead is the center of the complex.  Some kind of
wooden stake has been driven into the ground in the middle of the grounds ahead.
To the south loom the sturdy wooden gates.

   The air in this passage is cool.  The dark stone walls press in on each side.
A dark wood door rests in the east wall.  Its barely noticeable except for the
thin sliver of light showing underneath the door.  The passage continues to the
north and south.

A Dank Cell~
   This is a small dark cell.  Small mice scurry for cover at your entrance.  
Small piles of rotting straw are all the comfort that this cell provides.  It
stinks of sweat and excrement.  A small table rests in the middle of the room.
Thick leather straps have been attached to the table.

The End of the Passage~
   This is the end of a long dark passage.  Two heavy oaken doors are on either
side of the passage.  Movement can be heard behind the door to the east.  A
metallic grinding sound is coming from the door to the west.

Solitary Confinement for the Coder~
   This room is empty.  I guess Gicker isn't concerned about decoration.

Atop a Tower~
   You stand atop the north eastern tower of the Earth Cultist's Outpost.  The height
of the tower provides an excellent view of the lands to the east including the
north-south road a short distance to the east.  There is an opening in the
middle of the floor leads to a ladder leading down.
