Luskan Square~
   For the center of the village, Luskan Square is not a very big place.  A few
round stones have been placed to try and alleviate the problem of mud, but they
are scattered and the ground is mostly plain dirt.  A few people are here
enjoying the day and talking of times when Krynn was peaceful.

The Edge of the Town Square~
   Stones have been placed in this area because of the heavier traffic, but they
are quite spread out, and the ground is still mostly just dirt.  In the center
of the square is a small fountain, and many of the residents of Luskan can be
found gathering here frequently.

Oakwood Avenue~
   A sweet smell seems to come from the trees as you stand here.  A large
vallenwood stands just to the north of this spot, a perfect specimen of these
beautiful trees.  The avenue is no more then a dirt path, but it serves its
purpose for this village.

   Nothing.  A cloud of dust rises up from the path as you walk along.  There is
a bit of grass running along the center of the path, but mostly it is just

the sounds of animals coming from all directions.  To the west is Crystalmir

   This path is much alike to Vallenwood Lane, except smaller.  It seems to be a
small extension from the main road of Luskan, and it too is fitted with
cobblestones.  The road is well known by the citizens, for at the end of it lies
the chapel of Mishakal, recently built after the War of the Lance.  Beautiful
bushes with blooming flowers line the path, and the rustling of small wildlife
can be heard within them.

Inside the Luskan Armory~
   This impressive build is the Luskan armory and is the most famous smithy and
arms and armor shop in all of Northern Sword Coast.  Formerly owned by Theros Ironfeld,
weaer of the Silver Arm of Ergoth and forger of Dragonlances, it is now run and
maintained by his children, nieces and nephews, all of whom have mastered their
own particular speciality in weapons and armor crafting.  The smithy and shop
branches off into several different areas where different kinds of work are done
and where different types of armor and weapons and created and sold.

The Qualinesti Highway~
   This path is wide and well-traveled.  Tufts of grass sprout from the sides of
worn wagon tracks.  On both sides of the highway are forests of trees, mostly
the towering vallenwoods, but also the scattered pine and maple.  Wildlife seems
to be abundant here, with the sounds of chirping birds and chattering squirrel
ever-present.

The Northern Trade Road~
   This long, well-traveled path leads eventually to the docks of the Northern Trade,
connecting Northern Sword Coast to Icewind Dale.  The road winds and weaves past boulders,
massive trees and outcroppings of rock, but for the most part the going is not
too difficult.  There is foliage on both sides of the track and the sounds of
small wildlife can be heard not too far off the sides of the road.
