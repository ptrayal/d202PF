A Faint Path~
   This path is very faint and looks somewhat new.  The path obviously doesn't
see much traffic, as the grass is merely pressed down, and not actually worn.  
The path leads on to the north into the thicker portion of the forest.

Outside a Large Cave~
   To the north a large cave opens up before you.  A cool breeze seems to escape
from the cave.  You can't really see how deep the cave leads into the hillside,
but it does appear that the cave must slope downward, as you don't see much of a
hill above it.

Entering the Cave~
   Darkness envelopes you completely as you step inside this dark cavern.  You
can hear the faint trickle of water as it drips down the walls of the cave,
forming hundreds of miniature streams that delve deeper into the cave.

Inside the Cave~
   The cave appears to be carved into three different partitions that you can
see.  The cave does indeed begin to slope downward at this point, and then looks
to branch off into the northeast, northwest, and northern directions.  The
calmness here is almost eerie.

An Intersection in the Cave~
   The cave appears to be carved into three different partitions that you can
see.  The cavern branches off into the northeast, northwest, and northern
directions.  You can still hear the faint trickle of water, and you can hear the
water dripping from deeper within the caverns into a pool.  A trail of blood
streams off to the north.

crunch beneath your feet as you walk, very similar to the sound of bones

   The inside of the stable is kept quite clean.  A few animal droppings are
scattered on the floor amid the hay and dirt, but it seems to be regularly
maintained.  There are six stalls in all, each large enough for the average
workhorse.

Common Room of the Fireside Tavern~
   The interior of the inn is in much better shape than the weathered exterior.
Rows of booths line the walls and two large oval shaped tables adorn the center
of the inn's common room.  The heads of various animals are mounted on the
walls.  The low buzz of conversation is present as few bother to raise their
heads to notice you.

Common Room of the Fireside Tavern~
   This seems to be the quieter corner of the bar.  A large oval table fills the
majority of the area but a few small booths line the walls.  Perched on the wall
is a large map of the immediate area.  Sitting around the table are several men
absorbed in serious discussion.  Some are dressed in woodsmen leathers while the
others look to be clad in the expensive garb of merchants or nobles.

Common Room of the Fireside Tavern~
   Conversation is prominent at this end of the bar.  Several patrons sit around
a large oval table, apparently playing some sort of dice game.  The table is
littered with empty mugs, and even more packed with full ones.  It seems that
the game has been going on for quite some time and does not look as if it will
end any time soon.

Standing at the Bar~
   The bar is surrounded by eager patrons looking for another ale.  The long oak
table which separates the rowdy group from the bartender and the precious ale is
skillfully carved and surprisingly well finished.

Behind the Bar~
   The area behind the bar is kept fairly clean, considering the number of
patrons that are within the tavern.  Several tankards of ale line the floor of
of the bar, as well as a few filled with wine.  To the south you hear the
clanging of pots and pans, where a small doorway leads into the kitchen.  A
narrow staircase leads up to the second floor of the tavern.

A Dingy Kitchen~
   This tiny kitchen is a complete mess.  Dishes are stacked in disorganized
piles on every available countertop.  Pots and pans litter the floor along with
small piles of slop that you assume is being passed off as food.  A small stove
heats a pot bubbling over with foam, possibly the same slop that is on the
floor.  Surprisingly, and contradictory to the state of the kitchen, it smells
quite good.

The Top of the Stairway~
   Atop the staircase is a small loft with two equally small doorways.  There is
absolutely no furnishing or decoration, and the area seems to have seen better
days without a doubt.  Rowdy laughter and loud conversation can be heard at the
bottom of the steps.

An Unkempt Bedroom~
   This bedroom is rather well furnished, albeit with low quality decoration.  
The room itself is rather unkempt.  Clothes cover the floor, the bed is unmade,
small piles of tobacco cover the wooden floors, basically this place is a mess.
A plain wooden wardrobe stands against the eastern wall.  Next to it is a full
length mirror

A Small, Sparsely Furnished Bedroom~
   This room is rather small, and has little in the way of furniture or
decoration.  A thin mattress lies on the floor next to the southern wall.  A
small shelf runs along the western wall carrying an assortment of objects.  The
northern wall is covered in hooks, on which the residents clothes is hung

The Northern Trade Road~
   This is the Northern Trade road.  It leads north through the mountains on to
Icewind Dale.  It is wide enough for horses and wagons to ride on easily.  The road is
very dusty because the amount of travel on this road tends to dry up any rain
that falls here.  In the distance to the north you can see the road leading
through some mountains and beyond.
