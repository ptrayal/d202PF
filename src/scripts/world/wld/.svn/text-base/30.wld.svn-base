Gladiator Pits~
   These pits serve as Luskan's cruel form of justice, the gladitorial arena
where criminals are tortured publicly and pit in battle against impossible odds
for their freedom.  The ground is packed sand, and there is little else of note
except for the caged torture areas and the stone pillars that support the
walkways overhead.  In the midst of all on a raised platform is a throne where
the chief judge sits and makes his judgements upon the pitiful heads of those
criminals unlucky enough to find themselves in these pits.

A Prison Cell~
   This cell is large enough for several prisoners.  It is dank and a pool of
flith occupies one of the corners.  The smell here is atrocious and makes you
wonder how the prisoners stand it at all, as if they had a choice.  Small piles
of straw lie scattered among the floor, gathered together to serves as simple
matresses and pillows, and appearing as if they should have been changed many
moons ago.  The walls are thick stone built into the ground, with a small iron
grate allowing fresh air to enter high above.  The bars and gate offering a way
in and out are very strong and sturdy looking, and have been painted black.

Edge of the Gladitorial Pits~
   The smell of death and violence sting the air here with it's putrid, acrid
aroma.  What little light enters this area of the city seems dimmed and sad in
comparison to the rest.  Tall buildings surround a deep pit in the center of the
area.  Within the pit gladiators can be seen fighting each other and animals,
and cruel executioners can be seen torturing criminals in the last few moments
of their lives.  The ground here is littered with rotten fruit and vegetables,
the likes of which roving crowds use to throw at the poor souls doomed in the
pits below.  Looking abroad into the center of the pit, a large throne can be
seen on a raise platform, where sits the chief judge and his guards, as they
pronounce judgement on all criminals who pass through Luskan's immoral form of
justice.

surface above.  The floor here is laid stonework with sand tracked in from the
nearby pits.  Cells built for prisoners are here on opposite ends of the room.
A small table with a sturdy wooden chair is here for the guardsmen who watch
over the prisoners.

A Prison Cell~
   This cell is large enough for several prisoners.  It is dank and a pool of
flith occupies one of the corners.  The smell here is atrocious and makes you
wonder how the prisoners stand it at all, as if they had a choice.  Small piles
of straw lie scattered among the floor, gathered together to serves as simple
matresses and pillows, and appearing as if they should have been changed many
moons ago.  The walls are thick stone built into the ground, with a small iron
grate allowing fresh air to enter high above.  The bars and gate offering a way
in and out are very strong and sturdy looking, and have been painted black.

Edge of the Gladitorial Pits~
   The smell of death and violence sting the air here with it's putrid, acrid
aroma.  What little light enters this area of the city seems dimmed and sad in
comparison to the rest.  Tall buildings surround a deep pit in the center of the
area.  Within the pit gladiators can be seen fighting each other and animals,
and cruel executioners can be seen torturing criminals in the last few moments
of their lives.  The ground here is littered with rotten fruit and vegetables,
the likes of which roving crowds use to throw at the poor souls doomed in the
pits below.  Looking abroad into the center of the pit, a large throne can be
seen on a raise platform, where sits the chief judge and his guards, as they
pronounce judgement on all criminals who pass through Luskan's immoral form of
justice.

On a Walkway Above the Gladiatorial Pits~
Sturdy wooden planks and stout ropes have been brought together to form a fairly
stable bridge over the Pit below.  The stench of death mixes with shouts of
victory and screams of pain to make the air here very noxious.  Far below, a
gladiator can be seen running his spear through some wild beast, only to be
pounced upon by a large tiger shortly thereafter.  Further up the walkway is a
landing at the top of the dais.  Traveling away from the dais will take one back
to the seating at the edge of the Gladiatorial Pit.

On the Dais Landing~
You are in an unfinished room.  The wood and rope bridge leading up from the
commoner seats around the arena abruptly ends at a stone landing atop the dais.
Heavily armed guards stand at attention, wary of anyone attempting to bring harm
upon the chief judge.  Just beyond the landing, a small set of steps leads up to
the raised platform on which the twisted judge's throne sits.  Even this far
above the mayhem below one cannot escape the gutwrenching odor and cries of
agony.

Atop the Dais~
Far above the Pit below, the salty sea air mingles with the foul aroma of death
to create a sickening odor.  From this vantage point, the chief judge of Luskan
is able to view all of the bloodshed below to his twisted heart's content.  
Atop the dais, a large throne carved of stone sits on a raised platform.  On the
floor surrounding the throne is a large, dark red rug, its fibers dyed by the
blood of those who have been slaughtered below.

aroma.  What little light enters this area of the city seems dimmed and sad in
comparison to the rest.  Tall buildings surround a deep pit in the center of the
area.  Within the pit gladiators can be seen fighting each other and animals,
and cruel executioners can be seen torturing criminals in the last few moments
of their lives.  The ground here is littered with rotten fruit and vegetables,
the likes of which roving crowds use to throw at the poor souls doomed in the
pits below.  Looking abroad into the center of the pit, a large throne can be
seen on a raise platform, where sits the chief judge and his guards, as they
pronounce judgement on all criminals who pass through Luskan's immoral form of
justice.

A Prison Cell~
   This cell is large enough for several prisoners.  It is dank and a pool of
flith occupies one of the corners.  The smell here is atrocious and makes you
wonder how the prisoners stand it at all, as if they had a choice.  Small piles
of straw lie scattered among the floor, gathered together to serves as simple
matresses and pillows, and appearing as if they should have been changed many
moons ago.  The walls are thick stone built into the ground, with a small iron
grate allowing fresh air to enter high above.  The bars and gate offering a way
in and out are very strong and sturdy looking, and have been painted black.

street outside.  Around it, a large stone wall rises up into the air, towering
above you.  Through the portcullis can be seen rows upon rows of wooden benches
filled with cheering and jeering onlookers.  A faint scent of mixed blood and
sweat can be detected on the hot air coming from the Pits.  To the north,
several soldiers of all types can be seen milling about Warrior's Square.

The Arcane District~
   As you walk along the walkway, the Host Tower just off to your side, all is
quiet and calm.  You pass few people in this area, for it is well known that the
mages of the Host Tower are very secretive and dislike the presence of
intruders.  Such as it is, you see only a few people, and many of them are
apparent mages, or novices at the Host Tower.

Within the Host Tower~
   The ground floor of the Host Tower is open for the use of the public, with
training sessions occurring regularly.  The huge chamber serves as a research
library as well, with the more inexpensive tomes and scrolls being held here.  
Wards and spells have been said to be everywhere, as the Host Tower Mages
jealously guard their possessions from would be thieves.

Wizards's Cross~
   Wizard's Cross is a small street that connects Warrior's Square to the west
to the Arcane District to the east and the infamous Host Tower of the Arcane.  
Though this area of town still sees a large amount of traffic, citizens are
noticably subdued here, as they pass by the feared Host Tower and the
Brotherhood of Wizards that occupy it with great power.

poorer than others and a few areas that actually rival the lesser noble houses.
Small businesses are located here and there, mostly stores selling general
goods, and small stands where farmers sell their goods away from the hustle and
bustle of the market.

Gate to the Gladiatorial Pits~
You are in an unfinished room.  A large iron portcullis separates the interior
of the Gladiatorial Pit from the street outside.  Around it, a large stone wall
rises up into the air, towering above you.  Through the portcullis can be seen
rows upon rows of wooden benches filled with cheering and jeering onlookers.  A
faint scent of blood and sweat can be detected on the hot air coming from the
pits.  Off to the east, the massive East Gate can be seen towering above the
city.

Gladiator Way~
This street's paving is nigh nonexistent, its stones having been driven into the
ground long ago by the masses of people coming to see the spectacle of the Pits.
Even now, the crowd and its aroma are overwhelming.  People can be heard calling
and taking bets on the next fight.  Rundown barracks and storehouses line the
sides of the street, hiding within them the reserves of the city's guard patrol.

East Gate Plaza~
Booths and tents have been set up along the edges of the plaza.  From within
these, vendors can be heard advertising their wares, which range from mundane,
everyday fare to exotic and expensive novelties.  A large crowd of people
shuffles about on the poorly kept stone and mud of the street, coming and going
on various errands within and without the city.

Square is much more noisy than one would imagine.  Temples and shrines dedicated

On a Path Near Temple Square~
The cobblestone of Temple Square gives way here to a small dirt path leading to
the Luskan Gardens.  Chants and prayers can be heard clearly as one stands here
before entering the shade of the trees to the west.  A handful of people can be
seen walking back and forth on the path.  Those going to the Gardens seem to be
taking a much more leisurely pace than those who are returning, most likely late
for an appointment.

A Small Path Between Temple Square and the Luskan Gardens~
The heat of the city is quickly banished by the heavy shade provided by the
trees that line this narrow dirt path.  Birds can be heard from the Gardens to
the west, their song mingling with the prayers of priests and chants of monks
from Temple Square to the east to create a strangely soothing harmony.  Along
the trail, small bunches of flowers grow, adding a splash of color to the brown
and green of the trees and shrubs.

Many trees line this quiet trail, covering it in deep, cool shade.  Priests and
scholars alike can be seen walking by, some engaged in discussion with their
colleagues, some deep in thought.  In the canopy above, the sound of a multitude
of birds fills the air with a sweet song.

ferns, and flowers of all varieties.  Songbirds fill the air with their music,
accompanied by the chitter-chatter of numerous woodland creatures.  Beneath a
few trees, benches have been placed for the comfort of those who come to the
Gardens seeking respite from the maddening city around them.  Occasionally, a
scholar can be seen closely examining a particular species of flora or fauna.

scholars meet to discuss their findings on varied subjects ranging from the
tenants of the Gardens to the study of the arcane.  Even the denizens of the
Gardens appear to participate in these civil debates, their fear of man being
banished by years of peaceful existence here.  Around the gazebo, benches have
been placed to provide seating for larger groups to discuss and learn.

Pit from the street outside.  Around it, a large stone wall rises up into the

wooden benches filled with cheering and jeering onlookers.  A faint scent of
blood and sweat can be detected on the hot air coming from the pits.  To the
south, people can be seen wandering around the Luskan Gardens.

South Gate Road~
The bustling crowd is much smaller here, as most people who aren't going to
watch the slaguther at the Gladiatorial Pits prefer to avoid the pungent stench
of death and decay that surround the center of Luskan.  Cheers and jeers can be
heard now and then above the din of the street as the crowds at the Pits indulge
in their twisted entertainment.  Small booths have been set up beneath the trees
on either side of the street, offering food and drink for those who desire them.
Guards patrol the area regularly, looking for any who might be violating the
law.

An Intersection on South Gate Road~
Here the throng of people seems to disperse somewhat as everyone begins to go
off in the direction of their business.  Well-dressed, important looking people
head off down the flora-lined cobblestone street to the west on their way to the
Nobles' District.  Many more commonfolk keep walking toward the center of
Luskan, most likely headed to the Pits to watch the spectacle on display there.
The path leading to the east is much less traveled, as it leads to the Gardens
of Luskan, a menagerie of plant and animal life from all over the Sword Coast
and surrounding area.

creating the illusion of a sea of flesh and odor.  Guards can be seen carting
off those who are suspect of some violation or other at the gate.  Although the
street carries an almost continual load of heavy traffic, it seems to be fairly
well taken care of.  Large trees to either side provide shade for those who have
traveled long distances to rest under before continuing on into the city proper.

Luskan's South Gate~
This massive gate serves as the entrance into Luskan's southern end.  The iron
portcullis remains open at all hours of the day, closing only when danger
presents itself to the city.  Massive stone walls hide archers and pots of oil
ready to be boiled and poured on the heads of any who would attempt to enter by
force.  The dusty path of the highway gives way to the stone and mortar of
Luskan's South Gate Road just outside the wall.  People on various errands can
be seen entering and leaving the city, occasionally being stopped by the gate
guards for further inquiry into their business.  Now and then, a traveler is
carried away by the guards, further questioning being required before they are
allowed to continue on their way.

On a Path to the Luskan Gardens~
The trees lining the sides of this path are much more dense than those of the
main road to the west.  At the east end of this narrow dirt walk a small wooden
gate stands the only barrier between the city and the lush wildlife it hides
behind it.  Very few people walk this path, most appearing to be scholars or
clerics.

Nobles' Cross~
The well-paved street of the wealthy districts of Luskan gives way to the less
maintenanced South Gate Road here.  The shrubs and flowers along the Cross have
been trampled into the dirt by the massive amount of traffic entering and
leaving the city.  Multitudes of people can be seen in the main road, some
merchants, some soldiers, some listless wanderers, all in a hurry to get where
they're going.  Toward the Nobles' District, the wealthy can be seen going about
their daily business, very few venturing toward the madding crowd on the main
road.

Nobles' District~
Brilliantly colored banners representing the wealthy houses of Luskan hand from
crossbars on the lamposts around the square.  The base of each post is encircled
by a small bed of flowers.  The cobblestones are kept in good repair, though
they seem shoddy when compared to those of Palace Square.  Aside from an
occasional messenger carrying news between the districts, everyone here appears
to be fairly wealthy.

Gate to the Gladiatorial Pits~
A large iron portcullis separates the interior of the Gladiatorial Pit from the
street outside.  Around it, a large stone wall rises up into the air, towering
above you.  Through the portcullis can be seen rows upon rows of wooden benches
filled with cheering and jeering onlookers.  A faint scent of blood and sweat
can be detected on the hot air coming from the pits.  To the south, nobles can
be seen going about their errands in the Nobles' District.

lamppost.  Couriers and nobles alike travel in both directions, some going about
business, others going about pleasure.  Houses of varying size, though all
lavishly decorated, line the street on both sides.

The Intersection of Palace Square and Lords Lane~
A massive archway creates a break in the marble wall of Palace Square here, the
cobblestone in the ground continuing on into the well-paved Lords Lane.  
Messengers and nobles come and go through the gate, some on important missions,
others on a leisurely stroll.  The pale white marble of the archway continues on
in the form of a large wall which encircles the entire plaza.  The gurgling of a
fountain can be heard to the west, while an occasional angry shout can be heard
to the north.

The Palace Square Fountain~
The center of the plaza is dominated by a massive fountain which is surrounded
by numerous marble benches.  Citizens of Luskan, both noble and commoner alike,
sit or stand in the shade of trees planted at the end of each bench, some
engaged in heated discussions, others waiting for an audience with a specific
lord.  On each side of the fountain, large inlays of the seal of Luskan have
been crafted into the cobblestone.  Messengers run swiftly across the square,
bearing important messages between lords.

The Intersection of Palace Square and Dockyard Row~
The wide path of Dockyard Row bottlenecks into a large marble archway crafted
into the wall surrounding Palace Square.  The well-paved, regularly repaired
cobblestone of the Square contrasts sharply with the poorly-paved, rarely
repaired stone of the Row.  Men and women in rich attire stroll around the
square chatting quietly while messengers dart about quickly between the large
homes that surround it.

On Palace Square, Before the Luskan Justice Department~
This corner of the Square is a bit more chaotic than the rest.  Guards can be
seen entering and leaving a large wooden door which has been framed into the
very marble of the wall of the Square.  Occasionally, there is an outburst of
violence as criminals are hauled off from the comfort of the Justice Department
to their judgement in the Pits.  This close proximity to the common vagabond
seems to keep the nobles of Luskan from venturing to this part of the Square.

On Palace Square, Before a Wooden Gate~
The wooden gate in the marble wall here seems out of place compared to the
glamour of the entries of the other lords' estates.  Common folk from all walks
of life congregate in larger numbers here than before any other gate.  Wooden
benches have been placed here in addition to the already existing marble benches
of the wall to allow for more seating for the multitude in waiting.  Even with
all the extra seating, there are still a number of people seated on the hard
cobblestone of the plaza, each patiently biding his time until his name is
called.  For the comfort of the masses gathered here, numerous trees have been
placed about the area, their foliage blanketing it in cool shade.

On Palace Square, Before a Massive Golden Gate~
Two massive slabs of gold have been hung in the large gap in the marble wall
here.  Of all the manors on the Square, this is the only one with armed guards
before it rather than behind it.  Precious stones of all varieties have been
placed in the cobblestone in mosaic style to create the seal of Luskan in full
color.  The people waiting here look to be more richly dressed than those
waiting for audience at the other manors.  It would seem that this is the
entrance to the estate of the Lord of Luskan.

On Palace Square, Before a Stately Manor~
Unlike the other mansions around Palace Square that have gates or portcullises,
this one has nothing but a large gap in the wall before it.  The same benches
carved from the marble of the wall are still visible, with the same patrons as
every other lining them.  Before the opening, in the Square itself, two massive
trees tower above everything else.  The cobblestones surrounding their massive
bases look as if they have been progressively removed as the trees keep growing
larger.  Birdsong can be heard clearly when one stands beneath them, and
squirrels can be seen darting to and fro gathering nuts and chittering at one
another.

On Palace Square, Before a Large Gate~
The marble wall of the Square is interrupted here by a large wooden gate.  
Behind the gate, a long, tree-lined path can be seen leading to a very large
house.  Few citizens sit on the benches here, as most of the people on their way
to the manor just walk on up the path.  The well-kept cobblestone of the plaza
is interrupted before the gate by the seal of Luskan, which has been inlaid into
the stones in highly polished marble.  On the air, a faint hint of salty sea air
can be detected.

On Palace Square, Before A Large Portcullis~
The marble wall around the square is interrupted here by a large, intimidating
portcullis.  Behind its wrought-iron bars, a cobblestone walkway can be seen
leading through what looks to be a well-kept garden.  Benches that appear to be
carved from the same piece of stone as the wall jut out from it here and there,
providing seating for those waiting for audience with the lord of the manor.  
The happy chirping of birds and the faint gurgling of the fountain at the center
of the square combine with the rustling of the trees behind the gate to create a
soothing, serene melody.

Warehouses surround the large open dock area with a few seedy taverns and inns
here and there.  Fisherman work their catch while merchant vessels and other,
unmarked ships lie in port awaiting the time to set sail once again.  Netting is
everywhere with barrels and crates lining every corner and filling all available
space.  Throngs of people mill about the area, set about with their work and
daily tasks.

Luskan's East Gate~
This massive gate serves as the entrance into Luskan's east side.  The iron
portcullis remains open at all hours of the day, closing only when danger
presents itself to the city.  A well-trodden road leads off into the forest to
the east The crowd here is much larger than at any other gate, as most of the
commonfolk enter Luskan here.  Guards can be seen questioning seemingly random
travelers about their business inside the city, taking away any whose reason
doesn't suit them.

wooden bar with an iron table runs along the western wall, with drinks served at

Lanterns hang from the ceiling at regular intervals, offering plenty of light,

Upon opening the heavy door to the office of the Luskan Justice Department, a
wave of noise crashes over you.  The stench of liquor, vomit, and other
not-so-pleasant odors combined is enough to make even the mightiest stomach
churn.  A formidable looking man who appears to be the warden sits behind a
large desk, writing almost constantly in the convict register.  Guards come and
go regularly, some bringing in new suspects, others escorting those convicted to
their fate in the Gladiatorial Pits.

A large vault door in the back wall of the room is the most noticeable feature
upon entering the bank.  Then one begins to notice the multitude of people in
line waiting to make their transactions.  People of all sorts, from trader to
noble to prostitute, are gathered here, some being patient in their wait, others
voicing their discontent at the long wait.  The heat and smell of all of these
bodies crowded together in such a small space does nothing to inhibit the
tellers from taking their sweet time with each transaction.  This definitely is
not the place to be if you're claustrophobic, in a hurry, or have any intention
of taking care of your business before your next shave.

Running along the eastern wall is a large bar, behind which sits a befuddled

A Hallway in the Luskan Crafting Halls~
   This area is dry and well lit, and serves as the crafting hall area for the
city of Luskan.  People from all of the city come here to use this equipment in
order to create goods to use and sell for profit.  The adventurer community and
artisans have especially made this place their own as they often have the money
to pay the tariffs on that which is made.
