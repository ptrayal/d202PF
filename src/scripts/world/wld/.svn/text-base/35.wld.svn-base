Descending Into the Sewers~
Just below the grate a ladder has been mounted so workers can descend into the
sewers easily.  Water trickles down the slimy stone walls, its dripping echoing
loudly in the confined space.  The metal of the ladder is rusted from years of
exposure to moisture, but the slime coating it makes it rather slippery.

At a Four-Way Intersection Below the Dockyards Grate~
Four branches of the Luskan sewer system meet here, creating small eddies in the
water as it runs out the western tunnel.  A slimy ladder leads up to a grate in
the street above.  Hints of red can be seen swirling in the water coming from
the eastern tunnel, while the tunnels to the north and south spew forth foul,
murky water.  Years of draining the entire population of Luskan's waste has left
this intersection covered in a film of muck and mildew, turning the once grey
and brown stones of the walls to a sickly green.

In the Sewers of Luskan~
Rust colored water flows on toward the western terminus of the sewers, carrying
with it garbage mingled with severed limbs.  The smell of spoil and rot is
extremely potent here, as the piles of waste lining the sides of the water's
channel are littered with body parts in various states of decay.  Rather large
groups of gouges, looking much like claw marks, line the walls of the sewers.  
It would seem the rats in this particular branch of the sewer have grown to
monstrous proportions from dining on the meaty bits dropped from the Pits.

In the Sewers Below the Gladiatorial Pits~
One can easily tell that the sewers here pass beneath the Gladiatorial Pits
above by the red tint that has mingled with the sickly green mold present
throughout the sewers.  From pipes halfway up the wall, an almost constant flow
of blood drains into the sewers.  Not only have the walls become stained by the
foul drainage, but the water is also tinged red as the lifeforce of those
slaughtered above mingles with it.  Large claws have created deep gouges in the
stone here, the freshest ones clearly visible as grey lines against a rusty
backdrop.

Beneath the Center of the Gladiatorial Pits~
Blood and gore flows from a large grate in the ceiling of the tunnels here.  
Body parts, both humanoid and bestial, can be seen piled atop the grate, either
too large or at the wrong angle to pass through into the sewers below.  
Directly below the center drain of the Pits, the foul mixture of water and blood
becomes a small whirlpool in the midst of the sewers.  The claw marks visible in
other parts of this branch are more numerous here, some of them reaching almost
to the grate above.  Apparently something has been trying to get the trapped
limbs from above.

In the Sewers of Luskan~
Slimy green mold covers the stone walls of the Luskan sewer system.  Years of
waste being thrown down into these damp, dank tunnels has created a perfect
breeding ground for all sorts of vermin.  At the bottom of this large tube, a
small stream of water flows, carrying with it much of the city's waste as it
flows out into the Sea of Swords.  Along the walls, rusted sconces that must
have once held torches have been mounted every so often, most likely for the use
of sanitation crews cleaning the sewers.

From the plaza above, the sounds of trampling feet and hordes of people echoes
down into the sewers below.  Within the column of light that passes through the
grate, filth and refuse of every sort can be seen resting along the sides of the
tunnel.  From the east, water which has been diverted from the River Mirar flows
through the sewers, washing most of the waste with it.  From time to time, a
squeak or splash can be heard in the distance, even the most quiet sounds
echoing clearly within the stone tunnels below the city.

The sound of traders and vendors reverbrates down into the sewers from Market
Square above.  Within the junk piled on the sides of the sewer channel, the
glitter of a lost coin can be seen every now and then.  As the water flows from
the east and makes the sharp turn to continue on its circuit, it deposits its
heavy cargo of garbage onto the western wall here, creating an enormous mound of
filth.  After rounding the bend, the water seems to be moving slightly faster,
carrying much less waste with it.

The metallic ringing of boots echoes down from the grate above.  Below Warrior's
Square, the water begins to flow more rapidly, its path becoming narrower as it
deposits its filthy sediment on the sides of the tunnel.  While the light
filtering down through the entry tunnel does help to keep the rats at bay, it
also manages to make some very unappealing bits of garbage readily visible.

breeding ground for all sorts of vermin.  At the bottom of this large tube, a
small stream of water flows, carrying with it much of the city's waste as it

have once held torches have been mounted every so often, most likely for the use
of sanitation crews cleaning the sewers.

In the Sewers Below the Commoner's Quarter~
Smoothly flowing water carries the waste from the Commoner's Quarter into the
long corridors of the Luskan sewer system.  Rats can be seen swimming in the
water, some carrying odd bits of garbage in their mouths.  The slimy green film
covering the walls makes for a slippery walk along this stinking tube.  
Occasionally, a splash can be heard as someone dumps their trash into one of the
shafts located throughout the city above.

Below the Commoner's Quarter Grate~
Old bits of food and refuse litter the parts of the tunnel that the water
flowing from the east doesn't reach.  Years of dampness and filth have created
the perfect environment for mold and mildew to grow, their rampant spread
coating the stone walls with a mucus-like green slime.  Squeaks can be heard
coming from all around, the rats that claim these sewers as their kingdom
voicing their irritation at your intrusion.

Descending into the Sewers~
Just below the grate a ladder has been mounted so workers can descend into the
sewers easily.  Water trickles down the slimy stone walls, its dripping echoing
loudly in the confined space.  The metal of the ladder is rusted from years of
exposure to moisture, but the slime coating it makes it rather slippery.

Below the Palace Square Fountain~
Excess water from the massive fountain above drains out through a pipe that
extends down into this bend in the sewers.  There is a constant sound of
splashing as it rushes out and falls into the tunnel, drowning out the squeaking
of the rats.  Another added bonus of the constant waterflow is that the refuse
littering the bottom of the tube is kept to a minimum, as most of it is kept
from settling in the churning current.  However, the added moisture has done
nothing to help the mucusy growth lining the stone walls.

Below the Nobles' District Grate~
In the light filtering down through the grate above, the murky brown water can
be seen flowing freely westward.  Piled garbage lines the stone walls of the
tunnel, creating a malodorous stench.  Rats run along the refuse, staying as
close to the edge of the light as they can.  As a foreign presence is detected,
the rats skitter off, running to hide their treasures in their nests.

waste being thrown down into these damp, dank tunnels has created a perfect
breeding ground for all sorts of vermin.  At the bottom of this large tube, a
small stream of water flows, carrying with it much of the city's waste as it
flows out into the Sea of Swords.  Along the walls, rusted sconces that must
have once held torches have been mounted every so often, most likely for the use
of sanitation crews cleaning the sewers.

Below Temple Square~
Aside from the mold and mildew present in any damp environ, the sewers here are
fairly clean.  The priests and monks above produce very little waste, most of
which is readily washed away by the uninhibited flow of water.  Chants and
prayers echo down into the tunnel through the grate above, their melancholy
sound creating a somber air in this chamber.  Along the small channel in the
stone of the sewer, murky water flows, its purpose to carry away the waste of
the city.

Descending into the Sewers~
Just below the grate a ladder has been mounted so workers can descend into the
sewers easily.  Water trickles down the slimy stone walls, its dripping echoing
loudly in the confined space.  The metal of the ladder is rusted from years of
exposure to moisture, but the slime coating it makes it rather slippery.

Approaching a Large Grate~
The stone walls of this tunnel are coated with slime.  Water runs around your
feet, carrying with it garbage, rotten food, and some other not so pleasant
waste.  An occasional splash can be heard as a skitteting rat loses its footing
and plunges into the filthy water.  The sound of the Sea of Swords crashing on
the shore can be heard to further down the tunnel, and a muck-encrusted ladder
can be seen ascending into a column of light to the east.

Before a Massive Grate~
A very large metal grate is all that separates the sewer system of Luskan from
the Sea of Swords.  The salty sea air does very little to help mask the
repugnant odor of the filth that has flowed through this tunnel over the years.
Before the grate, a mound of refuse has collected since the last daily cleaning.
One can only imagine what would happen if the filth around this grate were left
to build up for very long.

Before a Small Floodgate~
A large stone slab attached to an intricate pulley system limits the flow of
water diverted from the River Mirar.  This irrigation system was devised in
order to keep waste dumped into the sewers from piling up and creating a
terrible backup.  Constantly flowing water has kept the slimy mold present in
the rest of the tunnels from growing here, making the stone glisten with its
wetness.  To the west, the sewers extend on into the darkness below the city.
