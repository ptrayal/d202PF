Before a Vast Cemetery~
   Before you a vast cemetery sprawls out in the distance.  The steep mountain
cliffs open up into a small valley.  In the distance, a ruined rose shaped tower
draws your attention.  Countless tombstones and grave markers lay strewn about
in this valley.  Overgrown grass and brush have taken hold in the cemetery.

Saren's Workroom~
   Large bookshelves cover every wall in this cozy room.  A comfortable chair
has been placed in the middle of the room.  A warm fireplace keeps the chill out
and bathes the room in a soft glow.

An Overgrown Cemetery~
   Tombstones and grave markers lay broken and damaged.  Grass and brush have
begun to take over the area, covering most of the tombstones.  A damp fog hangs
low to the ground, making it hard to even see you feet.  Something can be seen
in the distance moving through the thick fog.  It would be easy to lose your
sense of direction in this vile place.

Overlooking a Deep Chasm~
   A deep chasm splits the ground in front of you.  The darkness of the chasm
hides its true depth.  Billows of cold damp fog raise out of the darkness of the
chasm.  An old wooden bridge offers the only way across.  Across the bridge, an
immense rose shaped structure towers above the fog.

An Overgrown Cemetery~
   Tombstones and grave markers lay broken and damaged.  Grass and brush have
begun to take over the area, covering most of the tombstones.  A damp fog hangs
low to the ground, making it hard to even see you feet.  Something can be seen
in the distance moving through the thick fog.  It would be easy to lose your
sense of direction in this vile place.

A Wooden Bridge~
   Despite its obvious age, this bridge seems stable.  The bridge itself is wide
enough to handle a large wagon.  The decking of the bridge is slick from the
damp fog raising out of the chasm.  Railings line both sides of the bridge,
protecting one from slipping off the edge.

Nearing Dargaard Keep~
Emerging from the bridge, Dargaard Keep looms before you.  The fog continues
to rise heavily out of the chasm behind you.  In the distance you can barely
make out two sputtering torches framing the massive entrance gate.  You notice a
lone figure standing before the gates just ahead.

The Gates of Dargaard Keep~
   Two large gate doors grant entrance to this accursed keep.  The granite this
keep is made of has a reddish hue to it.  Closer inspection of the gate doors
show scorch marks along their edges.  Carved into the granite above the doors,
you see an inscription.  The inscription reads 'Est Sularus Oth Mithas'.

Before the Entry Hall~
   This area acts as the entrance to Lord Soth's entry hall.  A pair of arched
stairs raise along the walls of the chamber.  In the far distance you see a
raised dias, which holds a black throne.  From this entrance, you can access the
entry hall or the staircases.

Entry Hall~
   The grand entry hall is a huge circular room full of burnt, charred pews
facing the great throne at the far end of the hall.  Four huge circular diases
stand four feet high, two on each side of the room.  The burnt and twisted
remains of a very large chandelier sit in the center of the room where it fell
long ago from above.  The ceiling is four levels above.  Circular stairways rise
from each side of the wall, ascending to a landing on an upper level.  Black
rubble is strewn along the walls.  Bones and skulls can be seen under the
chandelier.  Footprints are visible up and down the outside aisles.  The soot on
the tops of the diases has been rubbed off.

Lord Soth's Throne~
   Up several semicircular steps is a great black, bat-winged throne.  Hideous
carved black skulls adorn the ends of each arm of the throne.  The throne area
has been scrubbed clean.  There is a clean purple velvet cushion on the seat.  
There is a strange human-shaped red stain draped across several steps.  It
appears to be permanent in spite of some abrasive scrubbing.

A Jail Cell~
   The walls of this cell are made of thick granite.  A heavy stone urn has been
placed against one of the walls to hold water.  A chamber pot rests across from
the urn, against the wall.  Two stone benches have been built out of opposite
walls, they serve as beds for the cells inhabitants.  The door of this cell has
been forged of steel.  A small slit sits at the bottom of the door, allowing
food to be pushed into the cell, or just big enough for a rat to crawl through.
