Standing at the Top of a Steep-Faced Cliff~
   The tall-grass plains come to an abrupt halt here at the top of a high,
steep-faced cliff.  Peering over the edge you can see the waves of the Lake Brenneghan
crashing against a rocky shoreline.  Built into the rocks, and extending quite
far into the reef is a large wooden dock.

Navigating a Rocky, Cliff-Side Pathway~
   The pathway that snakes down the rocky cliff face is wide but is rather
steep.  Wagon tracks can be seen on the trail, although it would take some
strong horses to pull even a light load up this grade.  The nearby shoreline is
covered in large, jagged rocks making it a very risky landing for ships.  
However, a huge dock system has been constructed, connecting the jagged rocks,
and extending far out into the reef.

Moving Through the Dry Reef Docks~
   These docks are quite obviously recently built.  The wood is soaked from the
violent crashes of waves against rock.  The layout of the docks appears to be
rather chaotic, connecting from outcropping to outcropping.  However, the widest
section of the dock stretches straight out into the reef to connect with any
incoming ships.

A Path Through the Forest~
   This narrow path winds its way through a thick forest.  The path winds its
way between the trees making it difficult to see anything that is in either
direction on the path.  The trees are alive with the sounds of forest animals.

Approaching the Outpost~
You are at the edge of a large cleared section of the forest.  Dominating the
clearing is a small fortress.  The emblem of the Earth Cultists flies from the
tops of the four towers on the wooden palisade.  To the southeast a narrow path
disappears into the thick forest.

Before the Earth Cultist Outpost~
Before you stands the Earth Cultists' outpost near Luskan.  Here the Cultists
have set up a training camp for new recruits to their priesthood and a place of
worship for the people of nearby Luskan.  The sturdy looking wooden gates are
usually open to all.  Guards walk the battlements and stand watch in the towers.

of Luskan stands out from the surrounding cedars.  On the eastern horizon, the
jagged outline of the mountains creates a breathtaking view.

Veering Off the Road~
   A small path veers off the road here and heads for a forest to the southwest.
The origins of the path are uncertain, but its direction cuts directly for the
forest, known as Qualinesti and home of the Qualinesti elves.  The path consists
of broken down grass cleared away by some type of movement along it.  The path
does not appear to be very old.

Nearing a Large Forest~
   The path begins to narrow as the forest to the southwest gets close.  The
trees appear to have been shaped somehow into intricate and beautiful patterns.
Not a sound comes from the forest, but a presence can be felt that causes one to
think twice about entering.

The Edge of the Forest~
   The edge of the forest is like a wall of trees that seem to go on for miles
in each direction.  You can barely make out a path entering the forest a few
feet to your left, but it is difficult to tell how far it goes before the forest
surrounds it.

The Southern Plains~
   The road is covered with patches of grass here, and does not appear to be
traveled often.  To the south you can hear the rush of water as a river splits
the plains, heading into the Lake Brenneghan.  The grass around the road is knee high,
and stretches as far as you can see.

Near a Large Bridge~
   A large bridge spans across the gap of a raging river just to the south.  
Along the road are patches of grass, indicating that this way is not traveled
often.  The road continues north and south.  In the distant south, mountains
loom up.

Oldroad Bridge~
   The river below moves at a swift pace.  The bridge is made of wood and metal
in a few spots, holding it together well.  It was built centuries ago by the
dwarves to make easier access to their kingdom for trade.  It has fallen into
mis-use though since the Cataclysm.  The river is known as the White-rage.

Approaching a Mountain Range~
   A mountain range, home of the dwarves of Thorbardin, lies a short distance to
the south.  The path is empty and barren here, as the dwarves have long ago shut
their doors to the outside world.  There is no vegetation along the road, and
the dust kicked up by the wind causes you to choke slightly.

Within the Mountains~
   The mountain range encloses this valley from the east and west, leaving a
view of only the road going north and south.  There is no life here, as
vegetation is scarce and long ago, the dwarves shut down this route for travel
by shutting the doors to their kingdom.  To the east, a small crack appears in
the wall of the rock formation, partially hidden by some dead brush.

The valley stretches out for a short distance, and then turns into a marshland,
which is odd for the climate here.  In the west, the road continues back to the
north.

A Road Through the Mountains~
   A path leads through the mountains towards the north and south.  High, jagged
peaks tower in the air above and at the very tips, snow is visible.  There is
very little vegetation and virtually no animal life, save for a few spiders or
snakes.  Vision is limited as the path is curved and sometimes steep.

from one side of the mountain pass to the other side with no way around it.  
The wall seems to be built out of the mountains themselves.  The gorge leads
further north and a road extends in that direction as well.  High peaks can be
seen overhead with their snowy caps and very little vegetation grows around
here.

Approaching a Slight Decline~
   Devoid of vegetation or life, this mountain path begins to snake between
peaks so mighty as to dwarf a god.  Not even scrub pines line this trail, and it
is a wonder who made it, as no tracks are noticeable.  The barren pathway
continues to the northwest, while a decline is partially visible to the south.

   Nothing could be more desolate then this mountain plateau, as there is not a
trace of animals or vegetation to be seen.  Mammoth snow-laden peaks surround
the plateau on all sides, screaming towards the heavens.  The footing atop this
mountain is very difficult, with pieces of mountain rock impeding movement.  
Between two imposing boulders, a scraggly path can be seen to the north, while a
precarious trail winds its way down the mountainside.

   This barren pathway snakes its way up the mountainside.  Not a sound can be
heard, and the area is devoid of life of any kind.  The footing on this trail is
treacherous, with loose stone crumbling underfoot.  High above, a plateau can be
faintly seen through the mist.

Beginning of a Mountain Trail~
   Rising into the clouds, this mountain is quite daunting, seeming to defy all
those who would attempt to scale it.  A few pine trees are the only life visible
around this mammoth obstacle, and closer inspection shows even less life farther
up the mountain.  A dangerous path is visible along the peak, without tracks of
any sort to identify whomever created it.  To the southwest, lush hills beckon
invitingly, a vast difference to this bleak and ancient behemoth.

Approaching a Massive Peak~
   Beautiful green hills stretch far in the distance, covered with trees and
life of all kinds.  Small woodland creatures are scurrying underfoot, creating
their own paths in the foliage.  Birds singing their sweet melodies complete
this picture of nature.  Looking to the northeast, a gigantic mountain can be
seen jutting into the sky, its top lost in mist.

Traveling Through the Hills~
   Lush green hills stretch as far as the eye can see, almost painful in their
beauty.  Small woodland creatures scurry underfoot, and birds fill the air with
their own private melodies.  The very ground seems teeming with life, the hills
themselves producing a unique energy, proof of nature at its finest.
