The Path to Crystalmir Lake~
   A cloud of dust rises up from the path as you walk along.  There is a bit of
grass running along the center of the path, but mostly it is just beaten down
dirt.  Surrounding the path on either side is a dense forest with the sounds of
animals coming from all directions.  To the west is Crystalmir Lake and to the
east the town of Solace.

Oakwood Avenue~
   People move along the small avenue going about their daily business.  There
is not much on the ground in this area, except the trunks of trees that hold up
the bridgewalks and homes of the residents of Solace.  Towards the south is the
central town square, towards the north is a walkway into the trees, and to the
west is Crystalmir Lake.

At the Bottom of a Spiral Staircase~
   A spiral staircase has been constructed here that leads to the part of the
town contained within the treetops.  Each step is made of finely crafted
wood, and due to the fine craftsmanship has withstood years of hard winters.  
The staircase is surrounded on both sides by a small railing, to protect against
accidents.  Sounds can be heard from the northwest, where an apparent festival
is taking place.

Oakwood Avenue~
   A sweet smell seems to come from the trees as you stand here.  A large
vallenwood stands just to the north of this spot, a perfect specimen of these
beautiful trees.  The avenue is no more then a dirt path, but it serves its
purpose for this town.

is good here.  A few small child toys have been left on the ground.  To the
northeast is Solace Square and to the south is a spiral staircase.

enjoying the day and talking of times when Krynn was peaceful.

The Solace Blacksmith~
   The Solace Blacksmith was not built in trees because of the heavy tools that
are used within it, and because of the extremely hot fires that continually burn
within.  Fine pieces of metal line the walls of the shop.  Some of them appear
to be artwork, but mostly they are weapons and armor created by the blacksmith.

and leads up to a large building resting separate from the other bridgewalks of
Solace.  The grass here has recently been cut, and it fresh and green.  The tree
appears flawless, a perfect example of the beauty of the Vallenwoods of Solace.

an alternate entrance to the Inn.  The rope is mainly used to cart supplies to
the Inns kitchen.

The Solace Bread Pantry~
   The smell of freshly cooked bread permeates through the air of this shop.  A
plump, balding man stands behind a large counter and twirls some dough around in
the air.  The entire place seems to be covered in flour, not from being spilled
but from moving through the air.

Forin's Pawn Shop~
   This shop looks to be a converted home, and is filled with all manner of
items, including weapons, armor, clothing, strange-looking contraptions and even
some stuff you would simply pass off as trash.  A sign has been posted on the
far wall saying, 'Adventurers, please clean items before selling them'.  It
looks as if this shop has had a huge boom in business since the coming of the
adventuring community to Solace.

no child seems to be around.
