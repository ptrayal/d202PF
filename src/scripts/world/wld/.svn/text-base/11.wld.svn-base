Entry Hall~
   The grand entry hall is a huge circular room full of burnt, charred pews
facing the great throne at the far end of the hall.  Four huge circular diases
stand four feet high, two on each side of the room.  The burnt and twisted
remains of a very large chandelier sit in the center of the room where it fell
long ago from above.  The ceiling is four levels above.  Circular stairways rise
from each side of the wall, ascending to a landing on an upper level.  Black
rubble is strewn along the walls.  Bones and skulls can be seen under the
chandelier.  Footprints are visible up and down the outside aisles.  The soot on
the tops of the diases has been rubbed off.
