A Narrow Cliffside Path~
This long, narrow cliffside path runs far down the coast high above the Sea of Swords. The ground here is covered in debris, and looks as though it has not had much use as of late.
An ambiance of both curiosity and forboding hangs in the air as the waves break against the rocks below.

A Narrow Cliffside Path~
The path begins to narrow here, with only four or so feet between the cliff edge and the wall as the ground becomes even more uneven.
Large chips and cracks cover the stone surface, evidence of erosion on this ancient walkway.

Down a Curve in the Path~
The path here is at a slight incline, twisting around the edge of a cove. The water below looks shallow and clear and there is even a small beach, though from this height you can't see any way to access it.

Following the Cliff Road~
The path rounds out the rest of the cove here and it seems the corrosion is
lessened in this section.  The seabreeze is nowhere near as strong, and the
overhang of rock seems to keep the elements at bay.  There are a number of
strange marks carved into the wall here.

Strange Marks Wall~
There are several marks scribed into the wall, about the size of a human hand. Upon closer inspection, and some thought, they appear to form a skull.
There are other markings, some of which look as though they might have been words, but they aren't legible.

A Cliffside View~
From here the view of the roads route is clear. It runs for about two miles from the south northward, and bends to the northwest where it enters a fissure in the cliff wall.

Before the Threshold~
You stand in the shadow of the cliff wall, looking up to see patches of green running into the dark fissure. The path here is wet, and you can faintly hear the rumbling of running, falling water. The sheer size of this formation is awe inspiring.

The Threshold~
The ground here feels slick as you move over the small pools of water around your feet. Before you is a stairway carved into the fissure itself, with steep steps at least a foot and a half tall each.
It winds back and forth, upwards and forwards into the the cold darkness, daring you to take the first step.

Nearing the Top~
The stairs become a jagged line here, heading north. The climb is over, and looking down you can see that you've actually gone quite far. You can see part of the Cliffside Path from here, and a sliver of coast miles away.
Looking north, further into the fissure and across a gap, you can see water pouring out of an opening in the rock, where it falls into grooves leading down the side of the cliff.

An Old Door~
You stand in front of an old door, its wood splintered and scarred from abuse. Vines wrap through many of the holes in it, covering a rune that has been burned into the door.
The lock on the door however is in mint condition, and has not weathered since its installment. The keyhole is unusual in shape, and seems to require a special key.

The door leads into a natural cave with smoothed walls and floors, all of which
seem are made of stone.  The ground here is still slick with water, and you can
feel water droplets hitting your head from above.  As you look deeper into the
cave, it is VERY dark.

Your vision seems to be dampened in this room, as if the darkness is pushing into your eyes. You can see a faint light coming through crack high in the wall, and it looks large enough to squeeze through.
You can't shake the feeling that someone is standing right behind you.

A Forgotten Hallway~
This hallway looks as iff it hasn't been maintained in years. Cobwebs and mold cover the walls, and dust lays caked on the ground.
Looking back to the south, you can see that the frame of the door that used to be there has been filled in with stones and mortar, with only the crack you came in through open.
The wirey vines running along the ceiling and walls are growing luminescent mushrooms inside this hallway, which glow faintly with a yellow green hue.

Standing here and looking into the massive pantry makes you wonder who or what used to live here. There are barrels as tall as a human, and oversized yet empty sacks.
In the far, northeastern corner you can see a particular stack of old sacks in the shape of a bag.

Around a Pool of Clay~
You walk along the edge of a massive pool of clay. The walls here are covered with human replicas, all twisted and contorted into painfully awkward positions.
Most are nailed to the wall in one way or another, and some of them appear to be breathing and twitching.
There is a bridge to the north of you that walks over the pool.

The wall here has been carved into the rock, and seems both newer and incomplete compared to the rest of this sprawling underground hall. The path seems to open up to the northwest.

Southeast Wing of the Barracks~
You stand in the center of the southeast portion of the barracks, the room apparently cut into the rock. The stone here, however, is unpolished, and looks much newer than the rest of the area.
It is dimly lit by hundreds of glowing mushrooms covering the ceiling, giving the area a slight green tint and leading your vision to the many identical holes in the walls.

Champion's Quarters~
This room is lavish and fully furnished, looking as though it used to belong to someone important.
The carpet and walls are the same royal colored red though the color has faded over time. The furniture matches, all with dark red leather and cloth, and golden thread trim.
A fireplace sits in the wall in the center, its magic flame dancing long after the wood has burned away.

Along a Vine Covered Wall~
You walk along a near solid green wall over moss, mushrooms and thick, healthy vines. The amount of plant life, and sheer variety, is amazing.
You can see many potted plants growing in organized pots along the wall here.

Near the Edge of the Broken Greenhouse~
Looking down this steep drop into the valley, you can see that the fissure widens to a couple hundred feet across, making a near circular open field.
There seems to be spring out in the center of the valley, and you can see that various plants cover and span across the gap atop the fissure.

Atop a Pile of Bones~
You stand on top of an old pile of bones. These bones came from animals of many different shapes and sizes, and all ended neatly stacked up here.
A thick patch of moss in the center of the pile has giant footprints sunk into it. Whatever made them must have been quite heavy.

Viewing the Waterworks~
There is a guardrail here, surrounding a dam for the running water. The water is then funneled into a narrow, steep stream, and is supposed to turn a large watermill.
Though the gears seem to lead upstairs from this contraption, the mill doesn't seem to be turning.

A Demolished Greenhouse~
The vines spiral up the walls here, sprouting huge red and orange flowers. They smell sickeningly sweet, and appear to be bearing some sort of fruit as well, locked in small bulbs below the flowers.
Whatever produce that once grew here has been starved by these huge, pioneering plants.

A Ledge in the Greenhouse~
This one ledge offers a clear view of a large, darkened valley between the greenhouses, which appears to be the source of all the wild vegatation seen in this complex.
Large mushrooms can be seen covering the walls of the valley, as well as root clusters for the vines blocking your view of the sky.

The Waterworks Rooftop~

Standing outside here, the air is oddly still and quiet. The waterworks below sound distant, only a faint rumble, as you stand before the entrance to the giant metal dome atop the roof.

The Waterworks Rooftop~
There are cool stone walls here, guarding you from a steep fall from the roof.
As you peer north, you can see the fissure spread into a wider valley, and the spring that the stream flows from to the northeast.
You can barely see the sky between the crossing, twisting vines stitching over the top of the fissure.

The Sky Lens~
You stand at the base of a large telescope, which connects to the floor using a massive assembly of gears. It must be 25 feet long, and its assembly must be at least 15 foot tall.
Before you there is a panel of levers and switches which leads into the mechanics of the huge device.

You stand in a strange room, where the shadows along the walls and the faint lights above three statues give a feeling of endless boundaries.
Stepping further into the room, you can hear the statues move, opening their eyes and exclaiming in three raspy voices "Feed me!". They move for a second more, looking at the statues next to themselves, and then snap back into their original places.

The Dragons Lair~
This unfinished room was created by Kelemvor.
You stand on a platform with paths leading down on both sides, and a bridge connecting you to another raises platform. From here, you can see hundreds of broken trinkets, sketches and diagrams all over the walls.
Tattered carcasses litter the pools of water which flow from cracks in the walls and drain towards the spined cliff entrances to this room. You have found the Dragons Lair.

You stand inside of an arcane circle drawn about the floor, the rune glowing a deep bronzish gold as you enter it. To your right you can see a gazing pool, full of crystal clear water.
To your left, you can see a partially reconstructed skeleton with a fungal growth twisting around the bones, emulating a muscle structure. Closer inspection reveals several red, glowing cracks running through the moss like body.
