At the Top of a Crumbling Spiral Staircase~
Water rushes down from the open trapdoor above creating a distant roar as it
reaches the bottom of this dark descent.  The ancient stone of this once
grandiose stairwell has fallen into ruin.  All along the downward path, bits and
pieces of almost every step are missing, having fallen away some time ago.  
Great care must be taken to traverse this wretched way, lest one should join
them.

At the Bottom of a Crumbling Spiral Staircase~
This small chamber has seen no light for many years.  Carved from the very bones
of the earth, its slightly vaulted ceiling bears an opening from which descends
a derelict spiral stairwell.  A dripping sound can be heard at regular intervals
as the tiniest bit of water squeezes through the hatch above.  Sconces have been
carved from the very stone of the walls, their grip empty but for the dust that
has collected in them over the years.  To the south, a tunnel can be seen
leading deeper into the earth.

A Winding Tunnel~
Ages ago, this tunnel was carved from the earth as an escape route for the
inhabitants of the lost city of Illusk.  Years of disuse have left a thick layer
of dust on the smooth stone floor.  Along the walls, sconces carved from the
very stone of the tunnel itself sit filled with dust much like the floor.  The
only sounds audible this deep within the earth are those created by whoever is
traversing this ancient path.

A Winding Tunnel~
A faint light emanates from the southern part of the tunnel, its sudden
brightness mixing with the suddenly salty air to bewilder the senses.  Echoes of
gull cries and crashing waves float in along with the light and smell, creating
a truly disorienting contrast with the dank silence of the tunnel.  Here and
there, small carcasses can be seen on the floor, the amount of time they have
lain here apparent in the amount of dust resting on them.

At the Mouth of a Cave~
From the mouth of the cave that is the entrance to the ancient escape tunnel of
Illusk issues what once was a magnificent city street.  The smell of salty sea
air is strong here; the crashing of waves on the rocky shore below sends a
miniature deluge over the lower levels of the street below.  Large piles of
rubble line the street, the great stone face within which lies an antediluvian
city slowly succumbing to the voracious hunger of the Sea of Swords.  It has
been said that deep within the secret places of the Ruins of Illusk roam the
spirits of the people who once walked these very streets.

A Crumbling Street~
What was once a glorious city street now lies in ruin.  Years of erosion and
battering by the sea have caused the faces of the buildings to crumble and
collapse, their debris covering the street in piles of rubble.  The battering of
waves on the rocky shore below sends up a fine spray of mist, covering the
entire ruined city in a constant haze.  Above the din of the raging surf, the
occasional cry of a gull can be heard.

Inside a Collapsing Home~
Carved from the very stone of the earth itself, this was once a magnificent
dwelling.  The walls begin to curve inward halfway to the ceiling, meeting high
above your head in what must have once been a beautiful dome.  Now, however, the
floor of this house is littered with piles of rubble as the years have slowly
caused it to collapse upon itself.  Mixed with the shattered slabs of stone on
the floor are ancient housewares, looking as if they were left by someone trying
to escape in a hurry.
