Academy Ruins~
   You walk the ruins of the former Academy of Magic in Luskan, now lying
completely in ruins.  The sky seems to be perpetually overcast here and the
occasional sound of something moving can be heard.  The ruins appear to have
been completely looted, as nothing of worth is anywhere in sight.

Academy Ruins Basement~
   The basement of the academy ruins looks to have been equally looted by
thieves and previous adventurers.  The air is musty and smells faintly of myrrh.
There appears to be little left down here except for broken furniture and it
looks as if the area served once as a large classroom with shelves lining the
walls filled with broken vials and worm-eaten books and scrolls.
