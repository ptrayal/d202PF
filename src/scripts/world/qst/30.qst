Kill flaming hand mercenary fighters~
Kill 20 flaming hand mercenary fighters~
   The Flaming Hand Mercenary Band has been a thorn in Lord Taerl's side for
many years now.  Despite efforts to pay them off or drive them away they persist
and seem to have an interest in meddling in Lord Taerl's affair.  Our Lord has
finally gotten tired of all other avenues of diplomacy and has decided to wipe
them off the face of the earth.  Begin by killing 20 of their best fighters.  
This sigil will reward you automatically upon completion.  Now begone, I have
little patience for adventurers.  
~
   He sigil Benfirth placed upon you glows brightly for a moment and your reward
appears automatically in your hands.  You have received 5000 gold coins, 20,000
experience points, and 5,000 quest points.  You also receive a jade ring covered
in emblems of sea turtles.  
~
   The sigil disappears as you abandon Benfirth's quest to kill 20 flaming hand
mercenary fighters.
