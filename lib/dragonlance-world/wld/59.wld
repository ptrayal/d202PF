The Onyx Obelisk~
   A towering monolith of pure onyx rises up into the air for many, many feet.
Strangely enough, there is no sign of this monolith on the horizon elsewhere.
The strange tower is covered in runes of all shapes and sizes, none of which
resemble anything in particular that can be readily identified.  The wind howls
all around you, kicking up the dust at your feet forcing you to cover your
mouth and nose to avoid breathing in the choking particles.

Atop the Onyx Obelisk~
   The tip of this massive onyx monolith is a pyramid shape, with a gradual
slope.  The runes are just as numerous at the top, except they are deeply
engraved, as if that part of the onyx has been carved out.  Each rune is
surrounded by empty creases that make them appear like hingless hatches.

   The tip of this massive onyx monolith is pyramidal, with gradual slopes.  
It is covered in man sized runes, each of which is lined with empty creases,
that appear to be hingless hatches.  Most of the runes are unrecognisable in
shape.  However, you do spot a pierced disk, a double-lined cross, an X with
each tip ending in a diamond shape, and and a four-pointed star with a hole in
the middle.

At the Base of the Obelisk's Interior~
   The base of the obelisk is made of fine black and silver marble.  The walls
are still onyx, glossy and smooth as glass.  The air is stale and musty, as if
it has been here, unchanged for centuries.  To the north is a marble door,
looming above at about a minotaur's height.

   The door before you is made of pure marble beautiful black with startling
streaks of silver throughout.  There seems to be no keyhole, only a strange
imprint of a hand with long, slender fingers.  You try your own hand, but to
your dismay, it does nothing.

A Short, Marble Hallway~
   This staircase is carved out of the earth and has been structured with large
tiles of black and silver marble.  The air is dry and dusty, and smells like
stale bread.  No torches line the walls, nor is there any rubble through the
corridor.  The staircase is a tidy, if not dusty void, dark and ominous in its
isolation.  A spiral staircase leads downward into darkness.

A Smoky, Enflamed Chamber~
   The heat in this chamber is unbearable, as flames lick the glossy red marble
floors.  There is no apparent source of fuel, but still the flames blaze on,
rising and falling in intensity, but always fierce.  Several platinum doors
adorn the northern wall.

A Hazy, Smoke-Filled Room~
   This room is filled with smoke that has seeped under the door from the
enflamed cavern to the south.  Through the haze, the room can be seen to be
constructed of black and silver marble.  The gloss of the marble has long since
been covered by thick, black soot.

Wandering the Halls of Amethyst~
   The area surrounding you has seemingly been carved out of a huge deposit of
amethyst, neatly forming a strange cave of the radiant violet crystals.  The
ground is also made of amethyst, although somehow it is formed not of
cylindrical crystals, but as a smooth, glossy surface.  Your footsteps echo
strangely off the protruding crystals, and every few seconds a strange chiming
sound permeates the air.

A Spherical, Amethyst Chamber~
   This chamber is formed like the interior of a large globe.  Its walls are
formed of amethyst, strangely smoothed out into a glossy surface.  It is
difficult to keep your footing as you plod along, due to the slick surface and

Wandering the Halls of Amethyst~
   The area surrounding you has seemingly been carved out of a huge deposit of
amethyst, neatly forming a strange cave of the radiant violet crystals.  The
ground is also made of amethyst, although somehow it is formed not of
cylindrical crystals, but as a smooth, glossy surface.  Your footsteps echo
strangely off the protruding crystals, and every few seconds a strange chiming
sound permeates the air.

   This chamber is formed like the interior of a large globe.  Its walls are
formed of amethyst, strangely smoothed out into a glossy surface.  It is
difficult to keep your footing as you plod along, due to the slick surface and
rounded floor.  Strange black tubes protrude from the sides of the chamber at
regular intervals.  A strange, circular portal with a diamond-imprint in it's

Wandering the Halls of Amethyst~
   The area surrounding you has seemingly been carved out of a huge deposit of
amethyst, neatly forming a strange cave of the radiant violet crystals.  The
ground is also made of amethyst, although somehow it is formed not of
cylindrical crystals, but as a smooth, glossy surface.  Your footsteps echo
strangely off the protruding crystals, and every few seconds a strange chiming
sound permeates the air.

A Spherical, Amethyst Chamber~
   This chamber is formed like the interior of a large globe.  Its walls are
formed of amethyst, strangely smoothed out into a glossy surface.  It is
difficult to keep your footing as you plod along, due to the slick surface and
rounded floor.  Strange black tubes protrude from the sides of the chamber at
regular intervals.  A strange, circular portal with a diamond-imprint in it's
center blocks the way south.

Wandering the Halls of Amethyst~
   The area surrounding you has seemingly been carved out of a huge deposit of
amethyst, neatly forming a strange cave of the radiant violet crystals.  The
ground is also made of amethyst, although somehow it is formed not of
cylindrical crystals, but as a smooth, glossy surface.  Your footsteps echo
strangely off the protruding crystals, and every few seconds a strange chiming
sound permeates the air.

Wandering the Halls of Amethyst~
   The area surrounding you has seemingly been carved out of a huge deposit of
amethyst, neatly forming a strange cave of the radiant violet crystals.  The
ground is also made of amethyst, although somehow it is formed not of
cylindrical crystals, but as a smooth, glossy surface.  Your footsteps echo
strangely off the protruding crystals, and every few seconds a strange chiming
sound permeates the air.

A Spherical, Amethyst Chamber~
   This chamber is formed like the interior of a large globe.  Its walls are
formed of amethyst, strangely smoothed out into a glossy surface.  It is
difficult to keep your footing as you plod along, due to the slick surface and
rounded floor.  Strange black tubes protrude from the sides of the chamber at
regular intervals.  A strange, circular portal with a diamond-imprint in it's
center blocks the way south.
