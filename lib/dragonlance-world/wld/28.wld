Among the Seats Before a Small Stage~
   Rows of benches have been set up here for people to be able to relax while
they enjoy the shows performed all day long on the stage.  The ground is a
little moist in this area, but it is not rain water that wets the ground.  
Sometimes the performers go a little crazy and throw buckets of water into the
audience.

Standing at a Small Shop~
   This small shop has been set up by a man not familiar to anyone from this
part of Ansalon.  The objects he is selling seem unfamiliar, and yet familiar
at the same time.  A small tent has been set up just to the south of his table,
where the man lives by night when he is not selling his merchandise.

Inside a Small Tent~
   This small tent is the home of the man whose table is just to the north.  A
small cot and a few books lay scattered around the tent.  The ground is simply
the grass on which the tent was placed, its soft covering making for a
comfortable place to sit.

The Entrance to the Main Tent~
   This is the entrance to the largest tent in the festival.  Two large flaps
on either side of the tent are tied shut and a large sign reading "closed" in
Common has been hung on them.  Rumor has it that the main attraction of the
show, an illusionist named William the Starseer, has become ill and has
temporary closed the tent until he can once again perform his magical wonders.
