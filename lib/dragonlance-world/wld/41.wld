A Muddy Trail~
   A wide, muddy trail has been formed by wagon travel in recent time.  The
tall grass which lines the trail is broken and trampled, while the grass that
stood in these wagons way is utterly destroyed.  Mice and other small rodents
dash out of view into their burrows and quickly peer out of them in curious
fear.  A few scattered arrows are impaled into the ground beside some of the
holes.

Walking Through the Overgrown Grass~
   Overgrown weeds and bushes all but conceal this unwelcoming path.  Sharp
thorns from briarwood bushes tear at every piece of clothing that comes near
them, attempting to slow further progress to a crawl.  The sound of wildlife

The Infamous Slave Market of Lord Grismold~
   This jam packed marketplace bustles with hundreds of people coming from all
corners of Ansalon.  Virtually every race is represented here, be it slave or
slave master.  Those who are frequent visitors of the slave market have set up
their own tents, while others use the main stage to buy and sell their prized
slaves.  The ground has been cleared clean of all vegetation, and due to
frequent use, it is as hard as any city road.

Within Eben's Grave~
   Several feet below the surface of the ground above lies a small coffin made
from the wood of the majestic Vallenwood tree.  Tangled green moss hangs
loosely from the dirt walls of the grave, giving off a slightly musty odor.  A
thin layer of dust has settled upon the lid of the coffin, implying that it has
not been touched in quite some time.

At the Entrance of a Small Canyon~
   The once muddy trail has gained a firmer consistancy as small rocks blown
from the upcoming canyon have lodged themselves into the ground.  Short gusts
of wind emanate from within the canyon walls, causing loose dirt and leaves to
blow lazily along the ground.  The trail of wagon wheels can barely be detected
leading onward.  A small plaque has been affixed to the starting walls of the
canyon.  Two less frequented trails lead to the east and south.

In loving memory of Eben Willowthorn,

On this day, The 7th Day of the Month of Long Shadows, Year 289, our loving
son Eben Willowthorn fell to his death from atop the canyon walls.  This plaque
commemorates his short life for all eternity.  From this day forth, with great
sorrow, we name this canyon 'Eben's Canyon' in memory of our son.  We will miss 
you Eben.

At a Burial Site~
   Delicate, violet colored flowers line the edges of this small burial site.
Out of place in the vast plains of grass, it lends a touch of beauty to the
otherwise barren landscape.  A tombstone carved from the finest onyx sits
before a six foot deep hole in the soil.  Within the hole is a polished wooden
coffin, suitable for a small woman or child.

A Small Clearing~
   As the small clearing of weeds leads closer to the ominous rock formation,
the foul stench of death engulfs you in its pungent embrace.  Bones of small
animals litter large patches of trampled grass.  Directly overhead, vultures
patiently circle the immediate area expectantly.

A Small Clearing~
   The hazardous, overgrown path promptly comes to a halt at this point, as the
briarwood bushes suddenly recede into a small field of knee high weeds.  
Vultures circle the skies above, apparently awaiting their turn to feast on a
dead animal beneath them.  A ways off to the north east, a jagged formation of
ancient boulders juts proudly from the ground's surface.

An Enormous Rock Wall~
   An enormous, ancient cluster of boulders stands here, forming an impassible
rock wall.  Numerous birds have carefully made their nests among the rocks.  
Screaming violently, baby vultures sit in their nests hungrily demanding to be
fed.  Along side the formation, a small cave has been cut into its surface.

   The floor of this unkempt den is littered with the bloody, gnawed remains of
numerous victims that fell prey to the lions which inhabit it.  A slight
trickle of water runs down the side of the cave before pouring into a large
pool of blood in the center.  Malicious, aggressive growling is directed
towards you immediately upon entering.

silently.  The cause of its abandonment is obvious, its axle has been snapped
under the stress of crossing the mud at unnatural angles.  Its frame has been
picked clean, and little remains behind to be eaten or salvaged by the small
rodents that inhabit this grassland.

The Infamous Slave Market of Lord Grismold~
   This jam packed marketplace bustles with hundreds of people coming from all
corners of Ansalon.  Virtually every race is represented here, be it slave or
slave master.  Those who are frequent visitors of the slave market have set up
their own tents, while others use the main stage to buy and sell their prized
slaves.  The ground has been cleared clean of all vegetation, and due to
frequent use, it is as hard as any city road.

Standing Before the Main Stage~
   Looming more than twice the height of a full grown human, this enormous
stage is where the majority of slaves are sold.  A large crowd has formed
before it, talking amongst themselves as they eagerly await the next auction.
Several whimpering slaves can be seen chained ankle to ankle atop the stage.

The Auctioning Stage~
   Atop the weather beaten stage, a clear view of the clustered crowd comes
into view.  With very little open space available down below, people
frantically push and shove to get as close as they possibly can to the base of
the structure.  The cracked, flimsy wooden planks which make up the floor of
the stage reek with sweat and urine.  Barely suitable to hold the amount of
weight it is, the floor creaks and bends slightly with every step taken.

Inside Lord Grismold's House~
   A drastic contrast to the dirty slave market, this home has been
meticulously well kept.  Various items of exceptional craftsmanship furnish
Lord Grismold's dwelling, each of which was most likely aquired through slave
trade.  A dirty piece of parchment has been pinned to the front of a door
leading to the north.

parchment~
Esmalda,

A long time friend of mine, Sir Damien Calhoun of the Knights of Solamnia will
be arriving later this evening.  I expect you to have a feast fit for a king
prepared for this man when I bring him here after the slave market closes.
He has always been a well paying customer, and I intend to keep it that way.
If you fail me again, wench, you will be the next to be sold.

-Master Grismold-

The Kitchen~
   Immediately upon entering the kitchen, a mouth watering aroma of freshly
baked breads and broiled meats fills the air.  Huge pots of boiling water hiss
as they cook large heads of cabbage atop a cast iron stove.  Several cooks race
frantically around the room, desperately trying to prepare an enormous meal as
quickly as possible.

Lord Grismold's Private Study~
   Apparently Lord Grismold's private study, this room has the distinct smell
of cheap cigars.  A large glass-topped desk sits heavily in one corner of the
room, directly across from an enormous portrait of Lord Grismold himself.  
Sleeping on the floor next to the desk lies an obese orange cat, completely
oblivious to anything that wishes to disturb it.

wagons along side the path leading to the market, spare parts are in high
demand.  Young clerks quickly fill customers' orders as fast as they possibly
can.

of this tent opens to let prospective buyers enter.  Several dusty bearskin
rugs line the sparsely furnished dirt floor.  Behind a crude wooden counter in
the center of the tent, sticks of incense burn, emitting a constant cloud of
rose scented smoke.

A Shaded Path~
   This path which encircles a sun baked, mud complex has been painstakingly
cut out of a patch of briarwood bushes.  The windowless, vine infested walls of
the building give no hint as to what lies inside.  Sparse willow trees lazily
stretch their branches over the path, offering a fair amount of shade.

Wading in a Stagnant Pond~
   Stagnant, brackish water hosts a variety of parasitic insects.  Mosquito
larve squirms blindly atop a surface of brown, foul smelling foam.  
Occasionaly, small patches of foam dart under the water, as if being pulled
down by an unknown force.

At the Bank of a Small Pond~
   The ground has absorbed much of the water from the nearby pond, making it
very difficult to keep one's balance.  It appears whoever inhabits the area has
made this location their dump, as various pieces of trash and bodily waste can
be seen mixed in with the mud.

The Infamous Slave Market of Lord Grismold~
   This jam packed marketplace bustles with hundreds of people coming from all
corners of Ansalon.  Virtually every race is represented here, be it slave or
slave master.  Those who are frequent visitors of the slave market have set up
their own tents, while others use the main stage to buy and sell their prized
slaves.  The ground has been cleared clean of all vegetation, and due to
frequent use, it is as hard as any city road.

The Base of the Stage Steps~
   Looming more than twice the height of a full grown human, this enormous
stage is where the majority of slaves are sold.  A large crowd has formed
before it, talking amongst themselves as they eagerly await the next auction.
Several whimpering slaves can be seen chained ankle to ankle atop the stage.  
A set of steep wooden stairs leads upwards toward the stage.

Within the Holding Cell~
   Humid, musty air fills the surrounding area with a putrid aroma.  
Malnourished bodies line the walls of the cell, their bleeding limbs securely
fastened with antiquated metal chains.  A tiny hole in the decaying mud ceiling
is the only source of light available to the slaves.
