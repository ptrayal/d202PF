Exploring a Cave Passage Under Xak Tsaroth~
   Lit by torches, this cave passage opens up to a span of fifteen feet wide.
From the looks of it the cave seems to be both carved naturally and in some
spots dug out.  Looking ahead, a little ways down the passage begins to turn.

Approaching Xak Tsaroth~
   Slowly coming into view, the city of Xak Tsaroth can be seen.  Four images,
pillars perhaps can be seen, showing the center of the city.  Passed the city a
small image of the temple of Mishakal can be seen.  The path leads to the
southeast, and back towards the northwest.

At the Bottom of the Well~
   Large shards of rock lay scattered upon the ground.  Looking up, sunlight
can be seen coming down the opening of the well.  Three passages can be seen
leading off to the north, south, and southeast.
