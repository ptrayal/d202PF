Inside The Silver Mistress~
You are standing inside The Silver Mistress, a shop which
seems to be almost as much a temple of Shinare as a place
of business.  The premium quality of the items on the
shelves would seem to indicate a wealthy clientele,
befitting the goddess of wealth and commerce.   The decor
has a distinctly dwarven feel, giving you the sense that
the shop owner is either a dwarf or is catering to
Palanthas's dwarven population.
