A Charcoal Line Path~
   The gravel path is lined on both sides by red hot charcoals, heated air
scorches the entire area as molten lava flows through a nearby crevice.  Small
particles of ash fall from the sky creating a billowing blanket of grey.  To
the south a large structure looms over the smaller buildings of the area.

Black Dragonarmy Recruit Waiting Room~
   Over populated with many young warriors, the many deep voices can be heard.
Most of the young men in here are dirty, as if they just wandered in from a
battle they recently had.  A few wooden benches stretch from wall to wall, so
that the new soldiers may rest.  A few pieces of armor and a few sheaths can be
seen lying about.

The Center Courtyard~
   The gentle swishing and murmuring of the fountain waters give this courtyard
an air of tranquility.  The gardens surrounding the fountain are lush and well
taken care of.  Small birds fly around the fountain looking for scraps of food
or seeds from the nearby trees.

Before the Dragonarmy Recruitment Center~
   The gravel path ends here before two massive iron-banded doors, the large
building looks to be made from dark granite and there are no visible exits
except for the entrance.  A line of goblins ogres humans and draconians can be
seen inside the structure.

Inside a Large Building~
   Inside the massive iron-banded doors the building is unusually large, the
inner walls look to be made from the same granite as the outer except they are
bright and clean.  The stone floor in this area is covered by a massive rug
depicting a five-headed dragon in flight.  On the walls the candles are held by
sconces formed in the shape of dragon claws.

A Dingy Hallway~
   Walking through the hallways, the air is quite stale.  Low whispers can and
nervous laughter can barely be heard.  Torches flicker in the wind as you brush
by them, almost making it difficult to see the path ahead.  The once white
granite walls appear to be covered in moss and large rats scurry at your feet.

A Dingy Hallway~
   Walking through the hallways, the air is quite stale.  Low whispers can and
nervous laughter can barely be heard.  Torches flicker in the wind as you brush
by them, almost making it difficult to see the path ahead.  The once white
granite walls appear to be covered in moss and large rats scurry at your feet.

Red Dragonarmy Recruit Waiting Room~
   Over populated with many young warriors, the many deep voices can be heard.
Most of the young men in here are dirty, as if they just wandered in from a
battle they recently had.  A few wooden benches stretch from wall to wall, so
that the new soldiers may rest.  A few pieces of armor and a few sheaths can be
seen lying about.

A Well Trimmed Path~
   The park path winds between trees, bordered on both sides by neatly-trimmed
shrubs.  A fresh breeze passes through, and you feel tempted to just sit down
here and forget all your worries.  To the north you hear the sound of birds
singing and the splashing sound of water.

A Well Trimmed Path~
   The park path winds between trees, bordered on both sides by neatly-trimmed
shrubs.  A fresh breeze passes through, and you feel tempted to just sit down
here and forget all your worries.  To the north you hear the sound of birds
singing and the splashing sound of water.
