A Wide, Well-Travelled Path~
   This well-travelled path cuts through the tall grass like a winding snake.
Though the path runs mostly north and south, there are small twists and turns
throughout it.  The wind is light and refreshing here, if not a tad chilly with
the stronger gusts.  To the north you can see the thatched roofs of the village
of Bethel, and to the south the wide, open waters of the Bay of Branchala.

A Wide, Well-Travelled Path~
   This well-travelled path cuts through the tall grass like a winding snake.
Though the path runs mostly north and south, there are small twists and turns
throughout it.  The wind is light and refreshing here, if not a tad chilly with
the stronger gusts.  To the north you can see the thatched roofs of the village
of Bethel, and to the south the wide, open waters of the Bay of Branchala.

A Wide Path Through the Swaying Grass~
   This short path leads away from the village towards a large tilled field.  
Rows of produce rise high in the scenery to the north, and several villagers go
about their chores in farming the land.  To the south the village is busy with
islanders tending to the various household chores such as weaving garments and
preparing for the nightly village feasts.

A Large Farming Field Filled With Produce~
   This large field has been tilled and worked to produce a large variety of
vegetables for the islanders to feast upon.  Rows of corn occupy the northern
half, while peas and tomatos seem to occupy the southern half.  The western
half is filled with stalks of grains and wheat.  Many villagers raom about here
tending to the fields and harvest any ripe crops for storage and for the
night's meal.

A Large Farming Field Filled With Produce~
   This large field has been tilled and worked to produce a large variety of
vegetables for the islanders to feast upon.  Rows of corn occupy the northern
half, while peas and tomatos seem to occupy the southern half.  The western
half is filled with stalks of grains and wheat.  Many villagers raom about here
tending to the fields and harvest any ripe crops for storage and for the
night's meal.

Swimming North of the Shueball Court~
   This is the open sea about 30 feet out from land.  To the west rises a large
cliff wall, that comes much closer to your position beneath the water.  The open
sea extends as far as the eye can see to the north and east.  South of here are
some youth playing a local water game called shueball.

A Small Underwater Cave~
   This small cave is about 30 feet square, with a small chimney leading to the
surface for air.  It looks like it was natural, but is being excavated to make
it larger.  Mining picks are leaning up against the walls, and sealed crates are
stacked all throughout the room.
