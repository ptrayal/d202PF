The Long Road: north of Triboar~
   The Long Road moves through a wide open area of rough, bouldered prairie.  
Above, the big sky opens up; a sweeping canvas of deep blue streaked with sheets
of wispy white clouds during the day, which becomes an inky black backdrop
dotted with a million sparkling stars at night.  The surrounding grasslands are
home to a variety of wildlife such as grouse, rattlesnake and the ever elusive
prairie dog.  The highway continues north and south, toward a large
intersection.

The Long Road: between Triboar and Longsaddle~
   There are spectacular rock formations along this section of road; tall,
narrow pillars of sandy red stone that jut up out of the ground like fingers.  
Beyond these spires, a vast expanse of rugged veldt reaches out to the horizon.
The air, although quite dry, hot and dusty, nevertheless smells fresh and clean,
and somehow tinged with the spirit of adventure.  The Long Road continues west

for the most part it is quite barren out here.  The Long Road continues north

   A reddish glow hangs over the lonesome prairie landscape.  The sere grass
rustles in the dry, gentle breeze as rabbits and other small critters scamper
across the plains.  Off in the distance a coyote howls periodically.  The hot,
arid environment is physically draining as it sucks moisture out of the skin,
sapping energy away very quickly.  The Long Road continues north and south.

The Long Road: between Triboar and Longsaddle~
   A reddish glow hangs over the lonesome prairie landscape.  The sere grass
rustles in the dry, gentle breeze as rabbits and other small critters scamper
across the plains.  Off in the distance a coyote howls periodically.  The hot,
arid environment is physically draining as it sucks moisture out of the skin,
sapping energy away very quickly.  The Long Road continues north and south.

   There is a large butte west of here, forcing the highway to bend around it.
The sandy rock comprising the hill is a deep shade of dusky red with many
visible layers.  Its top is a relatively flat plateau and there appear to be a
few hardy trees growing atop it.  Each cliff face is almost perfectly sheer,
dropping away at a near ninety degree angle.  The Long Road moves north and

   Judging by the dried-out condition of the nearby savanna, this area seems to
get very little annual rainfall.  Vegetation is limited to coarse grasses and
sparse trees that are dwarfed, bare, and scattered.  Most of the topsoil has
been eroded by the constant zephyrs gusting in from the west, which stir up
clouds of stinging sand as they blow past.

The Long Road: between Triboar and Longsaddle~
   The Long Road heads onward through the rugged open country.  Hoof prints are
noticeable in the surrounding dust of the prairie, as well as large clumps of
animal spoor.  Now and again you can see the silhouette of a lone buffalo off in
the distance on the horizon.  The parched land is rocky and filled with many
small lizards, snakes and scorpions.

The Long Road: north of Longsaddle~
   A roughly-erected archway of timber spans the road here, acting as a crude
gateway to the small frontier township of Longsaddle.  The Long Road runs
directly through the center of the town, serving as both highway and main street
simultaneously.  Horses and cattle are the main industries here, judging by the
prevalence of tracks and droppings that are scattered about everywhere.

around before darting back inside.  Aside from the gophers, there is very little

shrubs and the occasional lonely wildflower as far as the eye can see.

   The dusty road cuts through a pastel meadow of faded green and yellow grass.
Larger vegetation is sparse, with only a few distant trees on the horizon.  The
air is dry and crisp, lightly scented with northern wildflowers.  The
surrounding landscape shows signs of strong prevailing winds, with patches of
earth blown bare in places and underbrush that has grown in unnaturally bent
over shapes.

The Long Road: between Longsaddle and Mirabar~
   The dusty road cuts through a pastel meadow of faded green and yellow grass.
Larger vegetation is sparse, with only a few distant trees on the horizon.  The
air is dry and crisp, lightly scented with northern wildflowers.  The
surrounding landscape shows signs of strong prevailing winds, with patches of
earth blown bare in places and underbrush that has grown in unnaturally bent
over shapes.

The Long Road: near the Lurkwood~
   The black trees of the Lurkwood beckon forebodingly to the east.  A
well-constructed fence of sturdy wooden poles has been built between the highway
and the forest, probably to keep any creatures therein from wandering out onto
the road.  It is not comforting that the fence is nearly twenty feet tall and
bolstered with braces of steel -- exactly what lies within the Lurkwood to
warrant such precautions?  The Long Road continues its way along the outer edge
of the forest.

The Long Road: near the Lurkwood~
   The black trees of the Lurkwood beckon forebodingly to the east.  A
well-constructed fence of sturdy wooden poles has been built between the highway
and the forest, probably to keep any creatures therein from wandering out onto
the road.  It is not comforting that the fence is nearly twenty feet tall and
bolstered with braces of steel -- exactly what lies within the Lurkwood to
warrant such precautions?  The Long Road continues its way along the outer edge
of the forest.

The Long Road: between the Lurkwood and the Crags~
   This is an intimidating stretch of road.  To the east, the inky black trees
of the Lurkwood loom ominously.  Now and again, deep, rumbling growls and
piercing shrieks can be heard coming from within the dark wood.  Luckily, a
tall, sturdy fence has been built along the east side of the road, serving as a
barrier between highway and forest.  To the west are the Crags; a dangerous
series of rocky hills filled with goblins, bugbears and other nasty creatures.
The Long Road continues its way between these two hazardous places.

The Long Road: across an icy plain~
   The northern reaches of the Long Road are cold and harsh.  To the south, the
rocky spires of the Crags rise up into the air.  Northward, an expanse of
ice-streaked tundra extends off into the distance.  The ground is always hard
and frozen this far north, regardless of season.  Only the hardiest animals can
survive up here, with adaptations suitable for the frigid climate.  There is a
massive iron bridge immediately northwest of here.

A Large Iron Bridge~
   This monstrosity of a bridge spans the River Mirar, a free-flowing waterway
that begins in the Spine of the World and races west all the way to the northern
Sword Coast, eventually emptying out into the Sea of Swords.  The rushing water
is white and numbingly cold.  Anyone who fell into the river would probably not
survive for very long.  Each riverbank is lined with solid pan ice.  The bridge
continues across the river to the northwest.  Southeast is an icy plain.

The Long Road: near Mirabar~
   Powerful mountains dominate the view off in the distance to the north.  
These massive domes of rock rise upward like great earth gods, dwarfing all that
is around them and casting long shadows across everything below.  There is a
slight vibration under your feet.  The ground seems to be shaking as if from a
small earthquake.  The road continues northwest and southeast, where it
approaches a large metal bridge.
