against the mountain, a rock overhanging protects it from the harsh rains and
snows.  You hear what seems to be the faint sound of a man screaming.  Looking
towards the large tent you see the front flap slowly start to open, and a pair
of eyes peeking out at you.

against the wall of the mountain providing it with greater protection from the
heavy winds that blow in from the west.  Adorning the top of the tent is a
small red and gold flag bearing a strange emblem.  Wiping blood from his
dagger, a small elven man emerges from the tent.

tent.  You see a small mouse scurry across the floor, and dart out the flap
behind you.

still clutched in his hand.  As he fell forward he knocked over the ink well,
its contents spilling out and dripping to the floor.

welcome.  As you approach the guards, they slowly remove their weapons from
their sheaths.

entrance to the cave, only an enveloping darkness.  Holding out your light you
see two passageways each veering off in seperate directions.

ceiling is now high enough so that you can stand upright again.  An enormous
lion moves about the room, upon seeing you it charges.  Much to your relief it
is chained to the wall not allowing it close enough to attack you.  The ground
here is scattered with pieces of clothing, and bones.  Possibly from those who
have attempted to unchain this huge beast.

hoping for a more instant death.  Several devices of torture are within the
room, the men chained here apparently have refused to talk, or perhaps just
give the insane doctor the answer he seeks.

A Hidden Room in the Cave~
   After pushing the crates aside you stumble past them into a small area of
the room that is fairly cramped.  Several of the crates and chests here have
been damaged, old rotting pieces of wood from the crates litter the floor.  A
few of the iron chests have been eaten through by rust.  The damp air of the
mountains seems to have damaged everything here beyond repair.
