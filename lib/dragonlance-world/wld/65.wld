The Dock at Sanction Harbor~
   This rough dock extends out into the bay.  The boards of the pier are
damaged and broken in many places.  Water laps at the bottom of the pier,
giving it a slight rocking motion.  Large ships which transport goods all over
the Newsea float moored along the pier, and traders and sailors continually
travel to and from the ships.

The Pier of Sanction Harbor~
   A rough pier extends into the mouth of the bay here.  Boards are missing in
places, and in others, the pier is extremely warped from the constant battering
of the seawater upon the planks.  Splinters of boards rise in many other
places.  A few burned out hulks ride low in the water just off the pier, while
a bit further out some newer vessels are moored.  Traders wander out to those
ships frequently.  To the southeast is a large ship hauled half-way onto the
shore.

On the Deck of a Dry-docked Ship~
   This rather small merchant vessel seems to have been dragged onto the
shoreline.  A small river of magma flows just off the bow, although the ship
seems to show no signs of wearing from the intense heat.  In fact, at a closer
glance, the ship stands straight up, as if immersed in water.  A small doorway
to the south leads into the crew's chambers.

At the Bow of a Dry-docked Ship~
   Standing at the bow of this vessel, you can see the sprawling mass of
Sanction before you.  The slums seem to overwhelm the city, quite a pathetic
sight indeed.  However, in the eastern part of town many large and apparently
new structures have been erected in this volcanic city.  Occasionally a trickle
of lava spreads into the sea, quickly hardening and sending off large clouds of
steam.

places, and in others, the pier is extremely warped from the constant assault
of the water upon the wood.  Splinters of boards rise in other places.  A few
burned out hulks ride low in the water off the pier.  A few sailors walk about,
keeping their distance.

The Pier of Sanction Harbor~
   The pier extends north along the shore of the Newsea here.  It is in very
rough condition, with many boards broken and warped rising above the level
surface of the pier.  Crates sit in places, waiting to be loaded on ships
arriving from other parts of Krynn.  To the east, you see a small path leading
towards a column of smoke rising into the sky.

The Rocky Beach~
   Located on the northeast shore of Newsea, and surrounded by the Khalkist
mountains, is the city of Sanction, the port city of the dragonarmies.  Only
two passes lead through the Khalkist mountains into Sanction.  They run north
from the plains of Estwilde and east from Neraka.

The Central Street of Sanction~
   Continually widening streams of lava flow through the city, flowing from the
three volcanoes which surround Sanction, called The Lords of Doom.  Stone
bridges allow passage over the flows, but the heat and fumes cannot be escaped.
A small, steaming manhole lies heavily within the surface of the street.

The Entrance to the Chapel of Takhisis~
   The entrance hall for the Chapel of Takhisis is rather dark and foreboding.
The stone of the temple is midnight blue and somewhat reflective, almost
metallic.  The dim light within also seems to be of a dull and deep blue shade.
Curtains of black and red adorn the walls, although seemingly only as
decoration.

   Within this spherical alcove is a blood red altar of metallic stone.  It is
covered in engravings of gold and silver depicting the many forms of the Dark
Queen.  The curved walls are pure silver and show the reflection of a massive
five-headed dragon.  The image shifts to that of a dark haired beauty, then to
a dark figure in heavy, ornate black armor, and finally back to the fearsome
five-headed serpent.

original structure is said to remain.  It is the largest structure left in
Sanction, excluding the Temples of course.

Just Inside the Inn of the Chromatic Dragon~
   Bustling with rowdy customers and vagabonds, the room is filthy with food
and drink encrusted on the floor.  Tables are packed side by side to seat as
many customers as possible.  You see the innkeeper behind a desk at the north
side of the room showing tenants to their rooms.  To the east lies the entrance
to the Information Center where all the news of Krynn is kept.

Entrance to the Information Center of Sanction~
   This hallway has been designed for the high traffic of those seeking
information from one of the many board rooms.  Travellers and citizens alike
come from all around to read about the events of far off lands, and the degrees
of those who are in a position of power.  A sturdy staircase leads up into the
second level which contains even more bulletin boards.

   Humans and elves shuffle by with their heads down with chains linking their

podium stands, raised about three feet into the air, and some slaves are being
auctioned.  Cells line the western side of the street.  Occasional whimpers can
be heard above the din of the auctioneer.

Intersection of Usurpers Row and Sailor's Alley~
   Two streets intersect here.  One twisting off to the north, and the other
leading east and west from here.  Far to the west, the topsail of ships are
visible in the harbor.  Far to the east, the top of the Temple of Duerghast
looms up before you.  Children in dirty rags glance wearily at you as they pick
through the garbage.  The unmistakable pungent odor of tanneries and fish
markets assaults your nostrils.

   Dilapidated warehouses line this narrow alley.  The doors are broken off
most of the houses, but a few seem to still be in use.  The pungent smell of
tanneries and a fish market reminds you that the sea lies not far to the west.
Swarthy looking sailors walk by, eyeing your valuables, while a few stumble by,
drunk from the potent liquor served in the bars of the port.  You can make out
seagulls circling to the west.

A few peasants walk along the bridge travelling from the northern slums to the

that in the central city.

A Narrow Street through the Slums~
   Peasants traverse this street in groups.  They don't look up as you pass,
and try to move as far out of your way as they can.  Dilapidated houses stand
side by side along this north-south street.  Rumbling coming from far above
gives you notice that the volcanoes are still very active.

A Narrow Street through the Slums~
   Peasants traverse this street in groups.  They don't look up as you pass,
and try to move as far away from you as they can.  Dilapidated houses stand
side by side on both sides of the street.  Rumbling far above and north of you
signals the activity of the unpredictable volcanoes.

A Narrow Stone Bridge over the Lava River~
   A huge stone bridge spans the lava river which surrounds the town.  The lava
sends a reddish glow upon the sides of the bridge.  Guards slouch over the side
of the bridge, pondering their fate if their masters decided to throw them
over.  One of the guards throws a piece of cloth over and cringes as it burns
into ash instantaneously.  A few peasants walk along the bridge travelling from
the northern slums to the central slum and back.

The Central Street of Sanction~
   Deteriorated buildings mingle with new, but poorly constructed buildings
along this street.  The central area of the city, separated into two unequal
portions by the largest lava flow, is a maze of slums, frequented by the
dragonarmy forces.

Entering the Business District of Sanction~
   This section of the city is much cleaner and more sanitary than most of
Sanction.  The occasional passing goblin adds to the mess, and garners a
disgusted glance from the other people nearby.  Merchants show off their wares
from streetside booths, calling out to passersby in loud, throaty voices.  
Most of the people here are well dressed, and obviously wealthy, though a few
poor people from the slums beg at corners.

Within the Captains Quarters~
   Upon entering the captain's chambers you are momentarily taken aback in
surprise.  The evidence of this ship being out of the ordinary becomes all the
more clear.  Rows upon rows of shelves are filled with glass vials, small jars
of herbs, and other strange and exotic miscelanea.

A Stone Bridge over the Lava River~
  A huge stone bridge spans the lava river here.  The lava sends a pale
reddish glow upon the sides of the bridge.  Guards stand at attention, blocking
entry into Sanction to all those unwise enough to attempt to enter unwarranted.
You can see tents and troops of the Dragonarmy outside the city to the north
and east, and can barely make out the Temple of Luerkhisis a distance to the
northeast.

The Policy Board~
   A large brown board is set here for residents of the Inn to post their
messages in and of the world.  A small bench rests near the board for those
reading the notes to rest their weary feet, but in front of it stands a
guardsman, scowling at any who try to sit there.  This particular area is set
up for who wish to know the laws of the land.

Outside Some Board Rooms~
   This hallway has been designed for the high traffic of those seeking
information from one of the many board rooms.  Travellers and citizens alike
come from all around to read about the events of far off lands, and the degrees
of those who are in a position of power.  A sturdy staircase leads down to the
ground level which contains other bulletin boards.

as a stool to rest upon while reading.  A slew of messages are stuck to the
slate board, detailing the various crimes leveled upon Sanction and her
citizens.

Floating in Thin Air~
   You are floating in thin air.  The only obvious way to travel from here is
down into the world of Krynn.  You have not yet become corporeal, but will be
soon, if you measure up.  Please read the help newbie files and see the policy
board to make your stay a good one.

Within a Dimly Lit Cell~
   With the large amount of slaves being sold within the slave market, this
cell is surprisingly empty.  Dimly lit walls show various signs of wear,
ranging from dried blood to scratch marks of the attempts of past slaves to
desperately escape.  The floor is covered in a thin layer of straw and leaves.

An Old Wooden Staircase~
   An old wooden staircase descends into an unknown darkness below.  The only
sounds heard are those made by your footsteps on the wooden boards and the
occasional scurrying of a small rodent.  The stairway offers no railing to help
guide your journey, causing each step to be very undeterminable.

At the Base of An Old Wooden Staircase~
   A dirt path leads to the south into a brick-lined tunnel.  Small, dimly lit
torches line the walls at 10 foot intervals, causing it to glow calmly.  The
sound of many voices is audible from deeper within the passageway.

south.

A Dead End~
   The tunnel ends promptly at this point, yet the voices continue to grow
louder.  Wooden planks jut down from the ceiling to the floor, completely
blocking any further progress.  Small rays of light pierce through holes in the
planks, implying that there is indeed something on the other side of the boards.
