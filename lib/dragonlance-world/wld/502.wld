The Luskan-Mirabar Trade Road~
   This road shadows the Neverwinter Wood to the South and River Mirar which
empties into the Luskan Harbor.  The area is lightly forested with plains
visible through the trees to the north.  The river has a fast current and is
wide enough to carry a small barge.  Shrubs and other plants dot the roadside,
and small hills obscure vision from time to time.  The road itself is well
travelled and maintained, with few pot holes or wagon tracks.

The Luskan-Mirabar Trade Road~
   This road shadows the Neverwinter Wood to the South and River Mirar which
empties into the Luskan Harbor.  The area is lightly forested with plains
visible through the trees to the north.  The river has a fast current and is
wide enough to carry a small barge.  Shrubs and other plants dot the roadside,
and small hills obscure vision from time to time.  The road itself is well
travelled and maintained, with few pot holes or wagon tracks.

The Luskan-Mirabar Trade Road~
   The road runs here along The Crags mountain range to the south and Spine of
the World to the North, and beyond it the frigid tundra of Icewind Dale.  The
road here is not as well maintained as it is closer to the cities and there are
many potential ambush points in the hills and mountains surrounding it.  There
is a small amount of shrubbery here, most of it struggling to survive in this
harsh clime.  The wind howls through the hills and mountain passes making things
colder and more difficult to move through.  The air however is crisp and clear,
and refreshing compared to that of the stifling city streets of Luskan and
Mirabar.

The Luskan-Mirabar Trade Road~
   The road runs here along The Crags mountain range to the south and Spine of
the World to the North, and beyond it the frigid tundra of Icewind Dale.  The
road here is not as well maintained as it is closer to the cities and there are
many potential ambush points in the hills and mountains surrounding it.  There
is a small amount of shrubbery here, most of it struggling to survive in this
harsh clime.  The wind howls through the hills and mountain passes making things
colder and more difficult to move through.  The air however is crisp and clear,

The Luskan-Mirabar Trade Road~
   The road runs here along The Crags mountain range to the south and Spine of
the World to the North, and beyond it the frigid tundra of Icewind Dale.  The
road here is not as well maintained as it is closer to the cities and there are
many potential ambush points in the hills and mountains surrounding it.  There
is a small amount of shrubbery here, most of it struggling to survive in this
harsh clime.  The wind howls through the hills and mountain passes making things
colder and more difficult to move through.  The air however is crisp and clear,
and refreshing compared to that of the stifling city streets of Luskan and
Mirabar.

The Luskan-Mirabar Trade Road~
   The road runs here along The Crags mountain range to the south and Spine of
the World to the North, and beyond it the frigid tundra of Icewind Dale.  The
road here is not as well maintained as it is closer to the cities and there are
many potential ambush points in the hills and mountains surrounding it.  There
is a small amount of shrubbery here, most of it struggling to survive in this
harsh clime.  The wind howls through the hills and mountain passes making things
colder and more difficult to move through.  The air however is crisp and clear,
and refreshing compared to that of the stifling city streets of Luskan and
Mirabar.

The Long Road: near Mirabar~
   Powerful mountains dominate the view to the north.  These massive domes of
rock rise upward like great earth gods, dwarfing all that is around them and
casting long shadows across everything below.  There is a slight vibration under
your feet.  The ground seems to be shaking as if from a small earthquake.  The
road continues east and southwest.
