   Short, green grass covers the area around you.  To the southeast, a forest

there is little life as the plains represent a true survival of the fittest
environment.  At times, strong winds cut across the plains, making travel all
but unbearable.

The Barren Plains~
   Short, green grass covers the area around you.  To the southeast, a forest
looms giving life to a greater part of South-Eastern Ansalon.  Here however,
there is little life as the plains represent a true survival of the fittest
environment.  At times, strong winds cut across the plains, making travel all
but unbearable.

An Intersection on the Plains~
   Three roads converge here to form an intersection on the plains.  To the
east, the road leads north east and north towards Sanction, and Khur.  To the
south, the road leads towards the Forest of Silvanesti.  And finally, to the
west, the road leads west towards the Plains of Dust.

The Edge of an Ancient Wood~
   The surrounding forest is thick with small brush, and larger trees.  A vast
difference from the plains to the north, this forest represents life in its
fullest upon Krynn.  The environment seems to breathe as if the forest itself
was alive, giving a peaceful feeling to all those who enter.  However, this
forest is also the home of the Silvanesti elves, who protect their domain with
cold determination.

Travelling Through the Forest~
   Stepping carefully along the edges of an ancient path, you realize the
forest around you is strangely silent.  The animals of this wood shy away from
all non-elves, and the forest itself seems to hold its breath as it is
diturbed.  A soft breeze makes the trees sway back and forth, and a sweet smell
seems to permeate the air.
