The Intersection of The Street of the Tempest and The Street of the Dew-La'echer~
   The wind howls as it courses down this long street.  The ground is hard
packed dirt, although wild gardens of varying colorful plants line its sides.
The buildings are made of a rusty brown clay, and have few windows, most likely
to keep the ever-present wind outside.  Murals are painted everywhere, most of
them depicting scenes of divine battles and infernos of fire.  The always
sounding tingling of the Dew-La'echer to the north is the only noise that
occupies this deathly quiet city.

Plaza of the Flame~
   The wind is especially strong here in this open plaza.  It seems to be one
of the few areas of the city where there is any kind of noise.  Vendors hawk
their wares and peasants from nearby farms sell their produce.  A few children
are present as well, although they seem strangely quiet and well behaved.  
Looming into the sky in the southwest corner is a huge building with wavy
crimson spires depicting raging flames.

The South Gate of The City of Morning Dew~
   The wind whistles past the tall iron gates that give access to the City of
Morning Dew.  The walls are tall wooden pallisades reinforced with iron
strapping and stone parapats.  The ground is hard packed dirt, and bestows a
variety of colorful plants that have managed to flourish in this relatively
harsh enviornment.  The city within is deathly quiet, drawing all of your
attention to a large sculpture in the center of the town.  Hundreds of web-like
crystal beams intricately interconnect to catch the moisture in the air,
creating a sparkling presentation of utter beauty.

rusty-brown clay that is ever-present in this city.  The walls look sturdy

of this tower is seen above the long winding staircase, where a large,
ballista-like contraption sits ready to purge any possible enemies from the

either side of the street, showing no windows, presumably due to the harsh wind
that ever blows through the runs of this city.

The Street of Chaotic Intent~
   Like all streets in this city, this one bears a strange name.  Its ominous
tone is well put, as the street is deathly quiet, with only a few sullen
figures making their way through the wide pathways.  Clay buildings line
either side of the street, showing no windows, presumably due to the harsh wind
that ever blows through the runs of this city.

At the Base of a Craech Tower~
   This large tower is built from wooden beams and set with the same
rusty-brown clay that is ever-present in this city.  The walls look sturdy
enough and seem as if they could withstand a modest assault.  The main feature
of this tower is seen above the long winding staircase, where a large,
ballista-like contraption sits ready to purge any possible enemies from the
city perimeter.

The Street of the Dew-La'echer~
   The wind howls as it courses down this long street.  The ground is hard
packed dirt, although wild gardens of varying colorful plants line its sides.
The buildings are made of a rusty brown clay, and have few windows, most likely
to keep the ever-present wind outside.  Murals are painted everywhere, most of
them depicting scenes of divine battles and infernos of fire.  The always
sounding tingling of the Dew-La'echer to the south is the only noise that
occupies this deathly quiet city.

Standing Before the Dew-La'echer~
   Rising up before you is the an amazng structure called the Dew-La'echer.  
It is formed of hundreds of crystal beams, intertwining with each other to form
a spherical web-like sculpture.  Moisture clings to each beam, making it
sparkle like a shining star.  A strange tingling sound comes from within the
sculpture, though there is no visible source.

Atop a Craech Tower~
   The wide perimeter outside the city walls can be seen from atop this tall
clay and wood tower.  The forest has been razed back a hundred yards to make
targetting easy for the archers atop this parapat.  Filling up the large
majority of the tower is a strange ballista-like device.  Instead of firing a
missile, however, it has a hollow opening in the front, and is covered in
arcane runes.  The sheer complexity of the device makes it reminiscent of
gnomish technology, although the runes are suspect of magical forces as well.

Inside the Dew-La'echer~
   The inside of the Dew-La'echer is a sight to see for sure.  The light is
almost blinding, as each droplet of dew sparkles brightly in your eyes.  The
edges of the structure are smooth and slippery, making them near impossible to
grip.  A loud tingling noise echos off the sides of the structure, making
communication quite difficult.

Above the Dew-La'echer~
   From this vantage atop the dew-la'echer, you can see the majority of the
city below.  The air is cool and crisp up here, and the wind blows steadily,
stripping the moisture from your skin and leaving you feeling a bit bitter.  
The crystaline structure of the dew-la'echer below is no less beautiful from
here, perhaps even moreso.  You can see some movement inside the small openings
between the strands.

Floating Above the Clouds Before a Fortress of Vapor~
   Here, high above the ground below, are endless whisps of cloud and vapor.  
It is difficult to see, although small beams of light penetrate the cloudy
interior.  Dew immediately begins to form on your face, making the going a
little uncomfortable.  To the east is a small fortress seemingly formed of
solidified pinkish vapor.

Within a Small Fortress of Solidified Vapor~
   You stand inside a large antechamber of this small fortress.  The walls are
of a pinkish hue, and seem to be magically solidified to prevent you from
falling through the clouds.  Through some similar feat of arcane ability the
clouds part, so that no vapor is present in the center of the chamber.  The
ceiling is made of a very thin vapor that seems to prevent anything but the
visage of the starry sky above you from coming through.
