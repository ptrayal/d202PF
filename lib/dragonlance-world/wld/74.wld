The River Torath~
   The River Torath streaks through the plains of dust, heading generally
south.  For miles in every direction the plains extend as a withered wasteland.
The landscape is barren and desolate, and aside from a few patches of crabgrass
near the shoreline, devoid of vegetation.  The wind rushes by you, striking
your ears like a wailing banshee.

A Bridge Over the River Torath~
   A small wooden bridge breaches the river here, extending over the rushing
waters.  The River Torath streaks through the plains of dust, heading generally
south.  For miles in every direction the plains extend as a withered wasteland.

The Plains of Dust~
   The infamous plains of dust extend for miles in every direction.  It seems
as if the landscape is completely dead, as almost no vegetation can be seen.  
The landscape is barren and desolate, and a haunting wind whistles in your ears
as it rushes past.  Small tufts of crabgrass sprout from the ground, struggling
to survive in the dehydrated ground.
