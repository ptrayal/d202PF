Morgion's Abode~
   The room you are in appears to be a cave, though it's hard to tell because
the walls are covered with substances you dare not touch.  One corner has piles
of what appears to be rotting corpses and decaying flesh.  Another is covered
by maggots and other even nastier bugs.  The ceiling drips with slime and pus.
The smell in here is absolutely putrid.  An exit to the west seems to give some
glimmer of hope towards escape.

A ladder above you stops at a metal panel.

Cave of Choosing~
   The cave you are in has 3 exits.  To the west, you see massive Vallenwood
trees.  To the north, a great library and huge, white walls and temples.  To
the south, a dark aura pulls at your soul.

A Hallway of Pure Ivory~
   This hallway is constructed of pure ivory.  The floors and walls are very
smooth, and polished, creating a beautiful appearance.  The smooth surfaces
create a mirror of the surroundings, and is somewhat confusing.  Hanging from
the ceiling are strange, glowing orbs, creating a very bright light.

An Obsidian Room~
   This room, unlike the rest of the small complex, is crafted of pure
obsidian.  The whole room is fitted together so perfectly, that it must have
been from some sort of magical construction.  A huge desk crafted from obsidian
takes up the majority of the northern section of the room, and upon the desk
lie many ancient spellbooks and numerous jars with strange labels, written in
some archaic, forgotten language.

A Marble Room~
   This room is crafted of pure marble, greyish in color, unlike most of the
small complex which has been crafted from pure ivory.  Although the room has a
somewhat plain appearance, it's natural beauty is almost overwhelming.  The
room is flawless, there is no sign of dust, or disturbance of any kind.

A Granite Room~
   This room has been constructed of pure granite.  The whole room looks as if
it were carved from one huge section of granite, and it has a very pale tint.
The room is decorated with ancient suites of platemail armor, standing like
statues in every corner, each suit of armor radiates a feel of great, mystical
power.
