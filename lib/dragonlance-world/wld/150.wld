A Small Grassy Field Beneath the Vallenwoods~
   Nice plush grass covers the ground here, perfect for children to play in.  
High above are the great branches of the vallenwood trees, shading and
providing cover for all who reside here.  A few flowers grow here and there,
adding more uniqueness to an already wonderful place.

A Narrow, Faint Trail in the Forest~
   A thin, narrow trail snakes through the underbrush between vallenwood trees.
Grass, and small bushes line either side of it, with the occasional flower
poking out to find some sunshine filtering through the trees.  Occasionally a
small animal runs across the path, or a bird swoops down, chirping.

Between Two Large Trees~
   The forest thickens with smaller trees here, the trail leading south
becoming more faint.  The large vallenwoods cover less of the sky, making it
easier for thick brush and small trees to cover the land more.  Between two
somewhat large trees is a simple wooden gate, intended to keep children from
wandering too far from town.

Entering an Infected Forest~
   As you walk past the gate, it quickly becomes obvious that something is not
right here.  A grey growth is slowly seeming to creep up from the creek on the
trees and plants along the path here.  The light, cheery chirping that took
place in other parts of the forest seems more somber and sadder here.

nice plush grass anywhere nearby.  The few plants that do live near the waters
edge appear to barely be alive, and some of them even dying.  Dark colored
frogs croak miserably here and there, with spots of grey and brown crowing up
off their once nice green skin.

over the top of the water, and the few plants that are in the water seem to be
dying.  The banks of the pond have a grey scum growing on them, just like the
few fish and animals that live in this area.

   The water in this creek smells badly, and probably would not be safe to
drink.  It flows slowly around the roots of trees, under muddy old logs, and
over slimy brown and green rocks.  The grass near the creek has gone grey in
some places, and died altogether in most, making the banks of the creek
unwelcome and muddy.

snaking paths of infection growing up the sides and to the roof, meeting limbs
from nearby trees.  The trees all around have similar grey snaking trails, and
large splotchy patches all over.  The forest here seems to be dying of some
strange infection.

of paper that he appears to be getting ready to write on, looking up at you
expectantly.  Every effort has been made to keep the infection out of this
tent, but it can be seen that it slowly is working its way in.

Walking Between Sick Looking Trees~
   The infected trees continue, though they do not seem quite as bad the
further one gets from the small, fetid creek that runs through this part of the
forest.  Two rather large vallenwood trees stand here, towering above the other
trees around them.  The infection has spread to them also, though it has not
reached very high up into the branches.  Between the two vallenwoods, a large
brush pile has been stacked up to block unsuspecting travelers from coming this
way.

Walking a Winding Path through the Forest~
   On either side of the trail, plants and shrubs have grown brown and grey
spots and streaks that seem to eventually completely take over the plant,
killing it.  It appears to be some sort of virus or infection that the plants
and animals have caught.  The dying plants crunch under your boots, leaving a
grey powder on the bottoms of them.

Approaching a Small Infected Pond~
   The trail widens out a bit as it comes closer to the pond.  The plants seem
to be getting worse as you go, making it seem like the pond may be what is
causing the infection.  As you watch, a small squirrel runs down one of the
trees, trying to dodge the grey powder on the bark.

The Banks of a Small Infected Pond~
   The banks of this pond are made of thick, slimy gray mud, with no flowers or
nice plush grass anywhere nearby.  The few plants that do live near the waters
edge appear to barely be alive, and some of them even dying.  Dark colored
frogs croak miserably here and there, with spots of grey and brown crowing up
off their once nice green skin.

Between Large, Infected Vallenwood Trees~
   A large brush pile is stacked up between two large vallenwood trees,
blocking the way to the east.  The vallenwoods are also affected by the
infection, but do not seem to be dying yet.  Strong branches still shade any
who walk beneath them, the infection having only spread so high up.  A little
creek can just be seen snaking through the infected trees to the west.

Along a Trickling Fetid Creek~
   The water in this creek smells badly, and probably would not be safe to
drink.  It flows slowly around the roots of trees, under muddy old logs, and
over slimy brown and green rocks.  The grass near the creek has gone grey in
some places, and died altogether in most, making the banks of the creek
unwelcome and muddy.

Inside an Infected Cave~
   The tunnel opens up somewhat into a cave large enough to comfortably stand.
The floor appears to have had a good deal of traffic, making it smooth and worn
down.  The walls are slick with water and grey covered moss and mold.  The
smell in the cave is nearly unbearable, a sense of dread settling in from the
very walls.

deeper inside the cave.  The water still can be seen here and there, trickling
around a stone or flowing over a grey mold covered rock.  A tall person can
reach the roof, and in some cases a person must duck to get by some areas.

this wall seems smooth and flat, making it look rather difficult to climb.  A

below.

A Cold Dark Infected Cave~
   With a low ceiling, and narrow openings between large boulders and rocks
jutting out of the sides of the walls, these passages are difficult at best to
get through.  An occasional dripping noise is all that's left of the water that
trickles through the cavern.  The infected moss and grey mold does not appear
to be as bad, deeper inside the cave.

A Cold Moisturized Infected Cave~
   The ceiling here is low, but not quite as narrow as the previous portion of
the cave has been.  The room widens out, the ceiling coming even lower toward
the edges, nearly to the point of having to crawl on ones belly to get through.
A pile of stones has fallen down in front of the main path here.

A Cold Moisturized Infected Cave~
   Huge rocks jutt out at odd angles, poking into anyone that walks by.  Slime
covered walls are grey, with splotches of brown, infected moss.  The floor is
covered in animal feces, that gets stuck in your boots, making it slightly more
difficult to walk.  A small fetid trickle of water gurgles around some stones
at your feet.

A Cold Moisturized Infected Cave~
   At this point in the cavern, the ceiling is very low, making it impossible
to get through without lying on your belly and crawling an inch at a time,
scotting along on the floor.  Damp and wet with fetid smelling water, this is
no fun chore to do.  Grey patches of mold and infected moss grow here and
there, getting all over your armor and clothing.

A Gaping Hole~
   A large, gaping hole is here in the floor.  A rickety wooden ladder pokes up
out of the darkness, daring anyone to try to climb down into the pit.  The
darkness here pushes in around you, the mold and musky scents stifling one's
breath.  A trickle of water can be seen along one wall, making its way over the
edge to splash on the floor below.

A huge, gaping hole opens up into a smaller chamber below.
The ladder is up against one side, waiting to be used.

At the Back of a Deep Cavern Alcove~
   This alcove is deep, a dead-end tunnel that is deep enough to hide those
that sneak back in here.  The infection shows little sign of having reached
this far, though the rock walls are still covered in slimy moss.  The ceiling
is low, and the walls narrow, offering some protection.

A Large, Open Chamber Filled with Noise~
   This chamber is large, with a hole at the top, in the ceiling.  The floor
has loose rocks strewn about it, though it is level for the most part, and
rather open.  A battle of some sort has been taking place for a time now,
evidenced by the amount of strewn corpses and splattered blood on the ground.
Magical creatures battle each other, fighting for their respective masters.

Standing At the Base of a Ladder~
   A ladder lies here broken on the floor, from what appears to be the result
of someone falling down it from the huge hole in the ceiling.  Looking up, you
can see that it was quite a long fall.  Shards of the broken wood scrunch under
foot as people walk about.  A small opening in the wall to the west seems to
open up some out of this cramped, airy room.

In Between A Bunch of Stones~
   Squeezing through a small crack between some stones finds you surrounded by
large stones, in a small room of some sort.  There does not appear to be any
exits at a glance, but a small crack may allow you to leave.  The floor is
rough and covered in stones.  The gray mold didn't make it in here, for some
odd reason.
