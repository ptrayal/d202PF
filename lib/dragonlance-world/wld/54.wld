Along an Underground River~
   The water continues to flow off into the north, northwest direction.  
Still, no fish, or any other living thing can be seen.  The water seems to have
a calming affect to it.

At the Bottom of a Well~
   The river slowly ends beneath a stone well.  Barely any light can be seen
from the top.  Nothing but the rushing water from behind can be heard.  An
eaerie feeling can be felt as you continue along your way.

Inside a Well~
   Cool wind rushes over your body as you feel yourself falling through utter
darkness.  You reach for something to grab hold of, but always come up empty
handed.

At the Ever Flowing Well~
   Strange vegetation can be scattered about the area.  Strange elements are at
work as various magical lights whip by your head.  Dancing lights and an easy
feeling soon calm your nerves.
