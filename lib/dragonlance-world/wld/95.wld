Walking Along a Paved Road~
   The road you are traveling has been kept with great care.  The large round
stones have been placed with such neatness as to show hardly any cracks between
them.  It makes for very easy travel, a rather nice change of pace from the
hassle of mud covered roads.  The road is well traveled it seems, you pass a
few people every now and then, all of which seem to be rather warm, and
welcoming to strangers.

Walking Along a Paved Road~
   This well paved road continues in a mostly northern direction.  The cool
breeze blows at your back, seeming to help you along your way.  Tall trees line
the edge of the road, their placement makes it apparent that they were planted
into the ground by man.  Though their size shows it must have been done many
years ago.  You hear the singging of birds and the scampering of other wild
animals.

Walking Along a Paved Road~
   The road heads in a mostly northern direction.  The limbs from the large
trees to either side of you hang over the road, keeping the hot sun from
beating down upon you.  And when the rains begin to fall, the massive trees
keep alot of the waters from ever touching the surface of the road.  Just a
little ways ahead of you, you can see a rather large wagon and a man knelt
beside of it appanrently trying to fix the wheel.

   The road here begins to turn slightly towards the northeast.  The large
trees are still placed along the road as far as you can see.  Off into the
distance you see smoke billowing high into the air, you quickly realize you
must be approaching a camp site or perhaps a town.  Here on the road is an
armored man kneeling next in front of his wagon, apparently trying to fix the
wheel which has broken during his travels.

Inside the Wagon~
   You have climbed up into the large covered wagon.  This is the place that
the family can sleep during long travels.  The canvas is pulled tightly over
the roof of the wagon keeping the weather outside.  There are a few crates
stacked up along one side of the wagon, possibly containing the posessions of
this family.  A young child sleeps peacefully on a rolled out blanket and his
mother shows fear of your strange prescence within her wagon.

   The road you have been traveling on has made a slight turn in a northeaster
direction.  The large trees still cover overhead, keeping the temperature on
this well paved road rather cool.  All the people you see traveling this road
smile as you pass and greet you warmly.  Every now and then you see some sort
of wild animal run across the road and dart into the trees.  The smoke you saw
billowing from the horizon earlier seems to be getting closer.  You wonder if
perhaps its just one fire, or maybe just the normal smoke from a fireplace in
the brisk evening.

   The road begins to head in a more northerly direction again.  The wind picks
up a bit, its force helping you along your way.  A large doe runs quickly
across the road in front of you, followed closely by her fawn.  They dash into
the protection of the trees and you hear them running, untill you can no longer
make out the sound of their steps.  Off towards the north a short ways you see
a rather large castle sitting upon a hill.  Faint sounds of trumpets can
vaguely be heard.

   As you continue walking northwards on this finely made road, you see that it
is headed directly towards the castle you see in the distance.  Perhaps this is
the home of some wealthy family, or perhaps the Keep from the older days when
the Knights were plenty and covered much of Solomnia.  You see nor can you
sense any sort of dangers ahead of you.  Though you can make out little of the
large structure, you seem to hear the sound of trumpets blowing growing a bit
louder as you move towards the castle.

Walking Along a Paved Road~
   You continue traveling with ease on this paved road.  You are heading almost
directly northwards.  The birds sing their merry songs in the trees which line
the sides of the road.  Their songs seems to almost blend in with the growing
sounds of the trumpets.  Looking ahead of you, it appears that perhaps there is
more than just the one castle up ahead.  You see the faint outline of other
structures.  You begin to think that perhaps its a town, and the largeer
structure would belong to the King or Lord of the small area.

   As you keep traveling in the same direction you see that where you are
headed is indeed more than just what you previously suspected.  There is many
other structures besides the large estate.  You see many people walking the
streets and talking warmly with each other.  Smoke billows out from some of the
homes and the Inn, giving that complete feeling of safety.  As you look towards
the large estate you see the massive doors being shut tightly as the trumpeting
ceases.  Perhaps there is some sort of time in which even the peasants are
allowed to enter the estate, and the sounding of the trumpets is the end of
such a time each day.

   As you continue northwards you are getting closer to the town with every
step.  The brisk wind at your back keeping you on track, almost as if urging
you to enter the town limits.  You see many people moving about the town, most
of which seem to be going into one sort of store or another.  The large inn can
be seen towards the western end of town, smoke billowing from its two large
chimneys.  The smell of spices and meats fill your nostrils, causing you to
quickly pick up your pace.

Approaching the Town~
   Walking along the stone road you are now approaching the town.  The large
trees which have kept the sunlight from your skin, have been thinned out as you
continue to the town, in a manner as to slowly let the light in a little at a
time so that your eyes may adjust.  You feel the people of this town you are
coming to care greatly about treating visitors with the respect they would give
their own family.  The sounds of the marketplace can be heard off in the
distance, and the smells of food rolling out of the Inn make your mouth begin
to water.

Entering the Town~
   You are now entering the town.  The people whom road the streets smile
warmly as they pass by you.  Ahead of you is the center street of this town.  
It runs in a north and south direction.  Several other streets branch off at
various points running to different areas within the city.  If you keep heading
northwards you arrive in the plaza area where you can sit and rest by the large
marble fountain.  A little further from there you can see the market square.

road you were previously on.  It is evident that great care is given to the
upkeep of the road within the town.  Smiling residents smile warmly and greet
you as you pass by them.  The loud commontion of the markets towards your north
can vaguely be heard.  Looking towards your west you see a rather large barn,
the young stablehand sits on a stool outside the door awaiting the next
customer.

hangs heavily in the air.  You can hear the sounds of the horses which are held
within.  Through the door you see a few workers tossing hay down from the loft
to the stalls.  A young stablehand sits quietly on a small wooden stool.  As
you begin to approach him, he lifts his head and smiles at you.

Looking around you see several stalls which are large enough to hold many
horses.  Above you is the hay loft, a couple workers are tossing the hay from
the loft down into the stalls for the horses to feed on.  Your ears are are
filled with various sounds of the barn, from the whinning of a large white
steed towards your north, to the sound of the horse pounding his hoof against
the stall door directly behind you.

   You are walking between a row of horse stalls.  The dirt floor is packed
tightly and covered with the stray hay that never quite made it into the horses
stall.  The smell of manuer raises strongly from the horses and fills your
nostrils, giving your stomach that uneasy feeling.  The workers up in the loft
do not appear to be effected by this at all.  Possibly they have been here for
so long they have grown accustomed to the smell.  To your north is a rather
large calm warhorse.  Its the only one of the horses in a stall to itself

stalls seem to be the most used, or possibly just not cleaned as much as the
others.  Whatever the case, the stench from the stalls pours into your
nostrils, making you feel rather nausious.  The horses in the stalls to your
north and south seem content to be eating the hay that has been tossed down
from the loft above.  Towards the west you see a wooden door which will lead
you into the tack room.

The stench filters up from the floor and fills your nostrils, giving your
stomach that nausiated feeling.  A large water trough sits in the far corner of
the stall, a place for the horses to drink from.  A large bucket attacked the
wall is filled with grain and oats a few times a day for the horses.  Its
apparent that those who run these stables take great care of these large
animals.

of hay sits off in one of the corners for the animals to eat.  The water trough
along the back side of the stall seems to have just been recently filled with
fresh cool water.  One of the stallions has his head down in the bucket eating
some of the grain.  None of the animals seem to care that a stranger has
entered their stall.

walk up closely to him.  The water trough at the end of the stall appears to
have just recently been filled with water, and the feeding bucket is full of
grain and oats.  The floor is almost completely clean of maneur and mud.  
Someone must pay good money in order to have this much care given to their
steed.

out.  The water trough has just recently been filled though a few stray pieces
of hay have managed to find their way into the water.  The animals within this
stall give no care that you have entered the stable.

are needed for the care of the animals.  Along two sides of the room hand
bridels and the saddles that belong to the owners of each horse.  You see a
small rat scurry across the ground and dart behind some of the bags of grain.
In the far corner of the room there is a ladder that goes up into an opening in
the ceiling.  It is possibly another way to get into the loft above.

ladder seems very sturdy beneath you, making the climb easy and swift.  As you
approach the top of the ladder you hear the sound of men talking, and
pitchforks scraping along the ground.  The aroma of freshly cut hay begins to
waft down from above and fill your nostrils, a much more pleasant smell from
the manueur which is caked onto your shoes.

but most of it is cramped with hay which will be used for feeding the horses.
The two large swinging doors which the hay is tossed through in order to get up
to this floor stand slightly ajar, allowing the fresh air from outside fill
into the room and mix with the aroma of the freshly cut hay.  Two stablehands
are working hard on stacking the hay neatly against the walls, they dont even
seem to notice you approach.

along.  Residents pass by you, smiling warmly as they see a new face in their
town.  Towards your north a ways you can see the center square where a large
fountain glitterling with jewels spews water.  A few paces northwards from
there you can see the rush of the marketplace.

stones you walk on make it easy for you to not worry about mud and dirt getting
on your boots.  Large oil lamps hang from posts along the street, giving plenty
of light during the night to travel safely throughout the town.  Directly ahead
of you is an intercestion, this street continues northwards to the marketplace,
and the other wanders off in a perpendicular direction.

you will remain on Center Street and be heading towards the fountain area and
marketplace.  Running east and west is Temple Street.  Towards the east you can
see a large structure which appears to be the temple of this town.  Towards the
west are two large structures, what they contain is not certain.  People move
about you in all directions, every now and then stopping and asking if you need
any help finding your way around.  The city guards look you over, and smile
slightly.

nearly quite as wide.  The oil lamps hang from posts along the side of the
road, allowing safe travels within the city during nightfall.  Citizens pass by
you and give you a welcoming smile.  If you keep walking towards the east you
will come upon the rather large Temple of this town.  Many people can be seen
moving in and out of its large doors, walking and chatting with each other.

sign of trouble.  They look you over carefully and give you a nod.  The paved
road makes the walk easy, and the sidewalks seem to be constructed out of some
sort of cobblestone, giving good traction even in the hardest rains.  You see
many people moving in and out of the temple towards the east, quietly talking
and walking with each other.

allowing travel after nightfall safe.  The city guards patrol the streets,
looking for any signs of trouble.  They look you over briefly as you pass by,
and nod slightly.  Towards your east you see the city's temple off in the
distance, surrounded by a large garden.

Temple Street~
   You are walking along the Temple Street of the city.  The cobblestone
sidewalks make your travel easy and pleasant, keeping you from having to step
into the mud and waters left behind by the heavy rains.  People rush by you in
all directions, chatting quietly with each other.  The city guards partol the
streets looking for any signs of trouble, they look you over carefully, and
slightly nod.  Oil lamps hang from posts along the sidewalks, allowing travel
after nightfall safe and pleasant.  Off towards the east you see a large Temple
surrounded by its beautiful garden, in which you can see people walking and
talking, while their children run and play.

Approaching the Temple Grounds~
   You are approaching the Temple Grounds.  The sidewalks which line the Temple
Street you were on begin to curve slightly, and eventually coming together
forming a small cobblestone path which leads directly eastwards through the
Gardens and to the Temple Steps.  You can see the two large solid doors of the
temple are closed, yet they open every now and then as people walk in and out.
The gardens surrounding the temple are full of some of the most colorful
flowers you have ever seen.  A few families can be seen in the gardens walking
and talking with each other, their little children running and playing amongst
each other.

Temple Grounds~
   You are standing on the cobblestone path that leads eastwards to the Temple.
Small grassy paths lead off in a northeastern and southeastern direction.  The
grassy paths will take you through the flower gardens of the Temple.  You see a
few people walking about within the garden talking quietly with each other, as
their children run and play amongst themselves.  Continuing eastwards will
eventually take you to the Steps of the Temple.  The large doors open slightly
and quietly as people enter and exit the place of worship.  A feeling of peace
seems to radiate from the temple and gardens which surround it.

Walking Through the Gardens~
   You are walking along a small path through the Gardens.  From the looks of
the worn out grass beneath your feet you can tell that many people walk though
these beautiful gardens.  The smell of grass and flowers fills your nostrils.
A few small animals scamper past your feet as you walk, they quickly dart to
one side of the path and hide under a bush.  The birds can be heard singing in
harmony in the large trees within this garden.  The sounds of the city, though
very close by, seem to be the furthest thing from your mind as you quietly walk
along the path.

Walking Through the Gardens~
   The path you are walking along through the flower garden seems to be well
traveled.  Your nostrils are filled with the aroma of freshly cut grass and
flowers.  The sounds of birds singing in harmony fills your ears, drowning out
the sounds of the city.  The brances of the trees provide a source of shelter
from the rains and sunlight during the harsh weather.  From the looks of the
many different flowers it is apparent that someone takes great care of these
gardens.  A few small animals dart past your feet and quickly runs and hides
under one of the many hedges.

is apparent that great care has been put into the care of this quiet place.  
As you walk the aroma of flowers and grass fills your nostrils.  The birds sing
in harmony high in the large trees.  Every now and then you see a small animal
dart across the path and quickly hide itself under one of the many hedges.  
You can see ahead of you a family having a picnic.  The adults chat quietly
with each other on a rolled out blanket while the children run and play amongst
themselves.

Walking Through the Gardens~
   The grass beneath your feet is worn from the wear of many visitors to the
gardens.  The branches from the large trees seem to canopy the area, keeping
the ground fairly dry even during hard rains, yet allowing plenty water in to
allow the flowers to grow to their brilliant size and color.  The construction
of the place is quite astonding, how a person could make even plants designed
in this manner is unknown.  Up in the trees you hear the sounds of many birds
singing in harmony.  Looking ahead of you, you can see a family having a pinic
together.  The adults sit and chat with each other on a rolled out blanket, and
the children run and play with each other.

   You have come to a clearing in the garden.  The trees open up above you and
allow as much sunlight as possible to touch your skin.  Many different bushes
of flowers surround the area, making this place a perfect spot to sit and rest.
The songs of the many birds in the trees can still be heard high up in the
limbs.  A small animal darts past you in a blur of grey, and hides itself under
one of the rose bushes.  A couple sits quietly on their rolled out blanket,
chatting with each other, and watching their children play not to far away.

Walking Through the Gardens~
   You are standing in a clearing within the flower gardens.  The trees have
been cut back to provide as much sunlight as possible to hit your skin.  Many
different bushes of flowers surround the area, making this a good spot to sit
and rest for awhile.  The birds can still be heard from high within the trees.
Rustling can be heard in the bushes, possibly from the scurry of small aminals
running to hide from your presence in their home.  The aroma of the many
differnt types of flowers fills your nostrils as you walk through the area.  
Three children run around playing amongst each other, their parents close by,
watching them carefully.

Approaching the Temple~
   You are approaching the stairs which lead to the large doors of the Temple.
The smell of roses from the gardens you just passed still carrys strongly in
the air.  The Temple seems to have been constructed entirely out of the whitest
stones you have ever seen.  Although the temple's doors are extremely large and
sturdy, the people passing through them seem to have no troubles at all pushing
them open.  A quick look through the door, as a man walks out, shows a long row
between the many pews and standing behind a podium speaking is a man dressed in
long flowing robes.

Standing on the Temple Stairs~
   You are standing on the stairs which lead up to the doors of the Temple.  
The solid white stones have been arranged so neatly as to not even show where
one ends, and the other begins.  The construction of the temple must have taken
quite some time for precision such as this.  The doors ahead of you swing open
slightly as people come and go from within.  A mans voice can vaguely be heard
drifting out from inside.  A few people rush past you and enter the doors, they
act as if they are running late for something.  Perhaps a service is being held
inside.

   You are standing at the entrace to the Temple.  Two large, solid doors stand
in front of you.  The Temple is made entirely out of a white stone, which seems
to radiate its light, illuminating the entire area even after darkness falls.
The roof extends out over the platform you stand now, large marble columns give
it all the support it needs.  Although the size of the doors are astounding,
those who enter and leave the building seem to have no trouble at all opening
and closing them.  The sound of a mans voice carries out the doors as people
make their way in, and out.

that great care is given to this holy place.  The tiled floor is completely
spotless, and polished to the point where you can almost see your own
reflection.  Along the walls hang various pantings, all which depict the
pathegeons of light.  Looking out of this room you see that the entire Temple
is made up almost entirely of one room, where many rows of pews sit, and a
podium in front where the priest is speaking.

be a good hundred or so feet high.  Large marble colums every few feet down
this isle support the weight of the large roof.  In the very center of the
ceiling is a section of stained glass.  The architecture put into this place is
quite astounding, it must have taken quite some time to get a fresco such as
that put into place.  The large podium stands up on a platform so that the
speaker can be heard clearly, and seen easily from anywhere in the room.

benches are kept polished to a point where one can almost see their reflection.
A few small books lay here and there in the seat, their contents most likely
written songs which are sung as a form of praise to ones God.  The large glass
windows along the walls allow plenty of light into the room during the daylight
hours.  And large candlesticks scattered about the room give off their yellow
glow to hold services during the evening hours.  Looking towards the front of
the room you can see the Priest standing behind a podium, his voice carrying
loudly over the crowd, so that all can hear him speak.

Standing Before the Altar~
   You are standing before the alar of the Temple.  It is made out of one large
solid stone, though it does appear the top can be lifted up so that things may
be placed inside.  This is where many come each day to bow in reverance to
their God, and ask for guidance in their daily lives.  A couple of stairs to
the side of you lead up onto the platform where the Priest stands behind the
podium.  As you approach he briefly stops speaking, perhaps in order to see
what you are doing.  Feeling that perhaps his speech has brought someone to
kneel before their God in reverance, he smiles warmly.

Standing Behind the Podium~
   You are standing behind the podium where the Priest stands before the crowd.
The large wooden stand, holds several religous texts used by this man as he
speaks to the crowds.  Looking to the wall behind you, there is a small wooden
door which leads into what appears to be an office of sorts.  A painting
contianing the symbol of a Kingfisher hangs neatly along the wall next to you.
As you approach the Priest he stops his speech and turns to greet you, though
looking in his eyes you can see hes a bit confused as to why someone would walk

staggering quite a bit.  Oil lamps hang from posts positioned along the edge of
the road, they give off their faint yellow glow in the evening hours, allowing
for safe passage through the town at dark.  Southwest of you is the central
sqare, the fountain area is full of people sitting and chatting with one
another.  Continuing along this road you will end up at the tavern, the sounds
of music and drunkards can faintly be heard coming from inside.

Cobble Way~
   You are walking along a street paved with cobblestones.  The rough surface
allows you to keep good traction even during the heavy rains.  This road heads
directly northwest of the central square, heading towards the tavern just up
ahead.  Various people pass by you on their way to and from the tavern, some
staggering quite a bit.  Oil lamps hang from posts positioned along the edge of
the road, they give off their faint yellow glow in the evening hours, allowing
for safe passage through the town at dark.  Southwest of you is the central

Before the Tilting Mug~
   You are standing in front of the local tavern.  The sound of muisc and
laughter can be heard coming from inside the front doors.  As they swing open
and closed people drift in and out of the tavern, some staggering quite a bit.
The cobblestone road leads right up to the front doors, where a large canopy
hangs over the front of the door, allowing people a place to dry their feet
during the times of heavy rains.  Oil lamps hang from posts along the edge of
the road, and on each side of the taverns doors, allow safe travel during the
evening hours.  A sign which has been nailed to the wall next to the door says
Tilting Mug.

Common Room of the Tilting Mug~
   You are standing in the common room of the tavern.  The area is full of
round wooden tables, where people sit eating and drinking.  Some getting rather
tipsy, and loud as they continue to pour the ale down their throats.  Several
people sit on stools which line the wooden bar in the far corner of the room.
Directly to the left side of the bar is a metal winding staircase that leads up
to the second floor.
