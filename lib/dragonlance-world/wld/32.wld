The Western Que-Shu Plains~
   Grass stretches out as far as you can see to the north, south, and west.  
The eastwall mountains rise up in the distant east, creating a jagged horizon
for the sun to rise over.  The path is well trodden, and a short distance to
the east there are small billows of smoke rising from the ground.

Near a Que-Shu Village~
   Along the eastern horizon you can begin to make out forms of buildings.  
Barbarians of the plains pass by this way often, and seem surprised to see
anyone else walking here.  There is a faint odor in the air.  It smells like
meat cooking over a large fire.

Nearing a Que-Shu Village~
   This path leads to a Que-Shu village to the east, and to the open Que-Shu
plains to the west.  The village is encircled by a large stone wall.  The
plainsmen are semi-nomadic, but with the difficult times spreading through
Krynn in the past three hundred years, have settled down for protection.

Just Inside a Que-Shu Village~
   The horrors of the world today come home as you step into this village.  
Living as best they can, these people survive by sheer force of will.  Strong
and proud, they look at you with a defiant nature as you enter their home.  
The village consists mostly of grass, countless tents set up around its edges,
and a few stone buildings.

around the room.  A small window in the northern wall reveals a trickle of
sunlight during the day.  The light allows the doctor to work but does not hurt
the eyes of his sick patients.

A Staircase Between the Seats~
   This staircase leads from the path above to the Sunken Arena below.  On each
side of the staircase are seats where spectators watch the fighting that is
going on in the arena.  The stairs appear sturdy, but how they were brought
here or cut into the stone is a mystery that no one in the village can

The Level of the Sunken Arena~
   Ths arena floor is stone but sand and other debris causes the footing here
to be difficult to manage.  A large bowl of seats surrounds you, and spectators
look down with jeers for interrupting the match of the contestants.  The
fighters in this arena apparently do not fight to the death, but contest here
as a rite of passage to manhood.

the temple and purify the worshipers.

   This temple was built more then a century ago in the days following the
Cataclysm.  Four large pillars support a large domed ceiling.  The ceiling has
a carving of the first elder to be venerated by the plainsmen, and is purely
ornamental.  The elements of nature still enter the temple through a gap
between the ceiling and the walls, purifying the worshippers inside.

chieftain of the tribe sits here while worship takes place to ensure his
dominance is held in check during rituals.  A small stairway leads from the
dais to an upper chamber, and there is a door to the right with a wooden frame.

   Ths stairway is of amazing craftsmanship.  Solid stone has been cut into an
apparent solid piece to construct a stairway leading to small upper level
within the domed ceiling.  To your right and left are the gaps between the
ceiling and the edges of the wall, and a breeze of cool air blows past you.

of the deceased.

A Plain, Circular Room~
   Small maps and other parchments clutter up a table in the center of this
room.  It is a strange room, because from the outside of the temple there is no
room for this room to exist.  Looking out the ground seems perfectly natural,
and you would guess the work of magic but for the strong mistrust of true magic
by the plainsmen.

against the northern wall with a small pile of bones near its front edge.

Wandering Through the Village~
   A narrow path wanders through the village that leads from the large, sunken
arena in the north to a stone structure in the south.  The path is still
covered with grass, but numerous broken blades and beaten down patches mark a
definite trail across an open field.

Near a Large Fire Pit~
   A large stone ceiling gives some shelter over a large stone slab here.  The
plainsmen use this enclosure for feasts that they hold at various times
throughout the year.  To the south is a large fire pit with some food roasting
above it.

Standing in the Fire Pit~
   Hot coals burn under your feet as you stand in the center of a large fire.
The flames seem to stick to your skin and you smell your flesh begin to burn.
The plainsmen look at you in amazement for a few seconds and then begin to
laugh at you hysterically.

The Edge of the Feasting Area~
   This is the eastern side of the feasting area.  A few blankets have been
spread along the ground for people to sit on while they enjoy their meals.  
Large wooden bowls and other eating devices have been set out for use during
the meal.  The atmosphere here is pleasant and peaceful.

Heading for the Village Hall~
   The path you walk on has gravel spread out across it to keep the grass and
weeds from growing along it.  The area is wide open and clear, and from here
you get a good view of the entire village.  A large circular wall surrounds the
village, keeping out unwanted intruders.  To the north is a stone structure
that serves as the village hall.  The elders of the tribe meet there to discuss
the future and debate justice.

In Front of the Village Hall~
   The village hall rests just to the north of here.  A small step leads up to
a stone floor that is smooth and flawless.  From here it is difficult to make
out the inside of the hall, but the roof seems to have a triangular shape to
it.  Four columns stand in front of the hall depicting battle scenes that were
victories for the plainsmen in days long past.

The Central Plaza of the Village Hall~
   The stone floor is cold and hard on your feet.  Despite the discomfort
however you marvel at the beauty of its unflawed, perfect symmetry.  To the
north is a long row of rugs where the village elders sit, and to the east and
west are other places to sit so the people can watch the discussions.

A Row of Seats~
   A long row of artistic rugs have been placed here for the elders of the
tribe to sit and discuss the affairs that threaten the survival of the
plainsmen.  A few pitchers of a spicy kind of wine are placed near each
blanket.  The elders enjoy warming themselves with the fine spirits while they
speak.
