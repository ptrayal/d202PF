The Foyer of the Wyvern's Tail Inn~
   This room is heavily furnished with all sorts of odds and ends.  A couple of
comfortable looking couches sit against the wall, ready to ease the load of any
tired travellers.  End tables of solid, polished oak adorn the sides of each
couch, and above them are lit lanterns, exquisitely made of pure silver.  A
well made, decorative rug covers the floor, sopping up wet tracks and leaving a
comfortable foot rest for road-weary legs.  Many small picturesque paintings
are nailed to the wall giving the room a bit of comfort and atmosphere.

Wonderous Qualities~
   This wonderous shop is filled with all sorts of vials and potions as well as
several other, unidentifiable items.  The shelves are well stocked with spell
components giving the area a rather musty, if not pungent odour.

items, most of them common household paraphenalia.  There is a rather large

The Cutting Edge~
   This small shop is lavishly decorated with nothing else but its sparkling
products.  Several jewel cases occupy the shop displaying wonderous wares of
silver, gold and even platinum.  A few suits of ceremonial armor stand against
the southern wall, while blades of the same make cover the northern wall.  A
long black desk fills the western edge of the room, with a small iron safe
bolted to the floor beside it.

The Flaming Coin~
   Many empty shelves line the walls here, their purpose unclear in a house of
money.  The room is divided in front and back halves, the back half where the
banker processes his exchanges.  Three large iron safes stand against the
further wall, visible when the banker goes behind the curtain which they stand
behind.

The Reception of the Wyvern's Tail Inn~
   Here is the reception area of the Wyvern's Tail Inn.  A long, oaken desk
occupies most of the northwestern end of this room.  Sitting on top of it are
sheafs of parchment, and a small vial of ink.  Two comfortable looking chairs
sit on the opposite side of the room, for people who are waiting for their
rooms or their occupants.  An elegant chandelier hangs from the ceiling
covering the room in a warm, healthy glow.

Within a Large, Odourous Stable~
   These stables have been built against the pallisade wall and although they
look like they've been constructed quickly, it appears that it was done with
some amount of skill as well.  The smell of horses and their waste is evident
in the air, and is certainly not a pleasure.  However horses are a valuable
animal to the forces of good, and its quite likely that the stablehands are
used to the air in here.  There are several stalls in here, each housing a
magnificent beast.  There is certainly not enough horses in here for the entire
forces, leading you to believe that these animals belong to the commanders of
the forces.

A Small, Flaming Alcove~
   This small alcove parts from the main corridor.  A large brazier has been
placed in the center, and spewing from it are blue-green flames, these ones
very real.  The tiled marble seems unaffected by the intense heat and no signs
of charring or even smoke are present.

A Wide Hall Through a Flaming Corridor~
   This wide hall extends through the interior of this temple.  The walls are
made of a topaz colored marble and flicker with the illusion of raging flames.
The floor is tiled with a similar marble, and has a glossy sheen to it.  Every
now and then a pair of flaming eyes appear in the flames blinking once and
staring straight at you, then disappearing.

A Hazy, Smoke Filled Chamber~
   This large chamber is filled with a hazy pinkish smoke.  The walls, floor
and ceiling are all made of the same topaz colored marble found elsewhere
throughout these walls.  In the center of the chamber is a large brazier filled
with a pile of burning incense and wood.  Illusory flames dance along the sides
of the walls, but bear no heat.

A Large Office with Walls of Flaming Murals~
   This room appears to be a large office, containing a large desk of solid
orange oak and several book shelves filled with glossed parchment.  The walls
are painted to bear a colorful mural of raging flames with warriors doing
battle against undead forces and obviously winning.  A light smell of incense
fills the air, smelling of wildflowers.

At the Top of a Narrow Steel Staircase~
   This very small room houses nothing but an extremely narrow winding
staircase that leads down into the depths far below the temple surface.  The
walls, unlike the rest of the temple, are bare and are covered in a glossy
clear sheen.

Within a Large, Busy Laboratory~
   This large area has been hidden from the rest of the temple and is quite a
sight to see.  Several gnomes work here constructing huge machinery that looks
like it would be used for war of some sort.  Also here are several red robed
men and women working on alchemal equipment devising new aids for the warriors
of this temple.  The area is loud and noisy with hammers and mechanized
equipment giving you a bit of a headache already.

A Small Hidden Treasure Room~

hoarde.  Many scrolls and arcane tomes are stacked on the floor.  Several
chests filled with promising wealth are scattered among the ground as well.  
Truly you have stumbled upon something of great value here.
