Navigating the Magma Tunnels~
   These tunnels defy all natural logic.  They seem to wind through a large
pocket of flowing, churning magma.  The tunnels are cylindrical in shape, and
are well lit by the glowing red-orange lava.  A mysterious invisible barrier
keeps the magma from crashing in, and strangely enough, also keeps the intense
heat at bay as well.  Curiously, your movements make no sound at all in these
hollow tunnels.

Navigating the Magma Tunnels~
   These tunnels defy all natural logic.  They seem to wind through a large
pocket of flowing, churning magma.  The tunnels are cylindrical in shape, and
are well lit by the glowing red-orange lava.  A mysterious invisible barrier
keeps the magma from crashing in, and strangely enough, also keeps the intense
heat at bay as well.  Curiously, your movements make no sound at all in these
hollow tunnels.

A Spherical, Amethyst Chamber~
   This chamber is formed like the interior of a large globe.  Its walls are
formed of amethyst, strangely smoothed out into a glossy surface.  It is
difficult to keep your footing as you plod along, due to the slick surface and
rounded floor.  Strange black tubes protrude from the sides of the chamber at
regular intervals.  A strange, circular portal with a diamond-imprint in it's
center blocks the way south.

Wandering the Halls of Amethyst~
   The area surrounding you has seemingly been carved out of a huge deposit of
amethyst, neatly forming a strange cave of the radiant violet crystals.  The
ground is also made of amethyst, although somehow it is formed not of
cylindrical crystals, but as a smooth, glossy surface.  Your footsteps echo
strangely off the protruding crystals, and every few seconds a strange chiming
sound permeates the air.

Wandering the Halls of Amethyst~
   The area surrounding you has seemingly been carved out of a huge deposit of
amethyst, neatly forming a strange cave of the radiant violet crystals.  The
ground is also made of amethyst, although somehow it is formed not of
cylindrical crystals, but as a smooth, glossy surface.  Your footsteps echo
strangely off the protruding crystals, and every few seconds a strange chiming
sound permeates the air.

Atop a Large, Marble Platform~
   This platform is made of the same black and silver marble that is so common
in these tombs, yet unheard of elsewhere in Krynn.  It is quite large, and
extends out into the smokey darkness.  A strong wind pushes down on you from
above, making standing here less than comfortable.  The occasional sounds of
stone grinding against stone echos throughout this massive chamber.

Atop a Floating Marble Platform~
   This platform is rather large and is made of the same black and silver
marble found throughout these tombs, yet unheard of anywhere else in Ansalon.
It floats in mid-air, slowly drifting through the darkness.  A strong wind
blows from above, making standing here rather uncomfortable.  Smoke rises from
below filling the darkness with heat and making breathing an arduous task.
