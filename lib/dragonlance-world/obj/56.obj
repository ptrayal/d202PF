scroll~
The scroll is carefully unrolled, and written upon it is this:
   I believe they will continue to follow you, do not give up in the plight.  If
they knew the truth, it could destroy them.  That I, am fighting for their freedom
yet I am not one of them.  It would send all of what we have worked for into chaos,
and we could not achieve our goal.  You must uphold the guise for a little while 
longer, I will continue to prepare the speeches, to keep them going.  We are close
to getting one of our own into the camp.  Once he is in place we will surely not
fail.  But you must endure this a little longer.  Give the speech, knowing that 
for our warriors to continue in our plight, it all depends on this delivery.  
                                                      Morgan Di Kyre

crystal~
This crystal is very worn, and appears to have been at one point connected with
another.  It has a rather rank smell too it, smelling slightly of garbage.  Odd
that such an item would be held on a leader such as Morgan Di Kyre.
