        Balak,
Our Dark Queen, Takhisis has instructed us to move against the Knights 
of Solamnia in the Keep known as Thelgaard. Her Dark Majesty has not 
set a specific date in which we are to strike, but she does wish the 
invasion to take place within the week. My White Dragonarmy, led by 
myself and Sleet shall be joining you if the snow storm here at Icewall
lets up. I suggest that you send Khisanth to Thelgaard first to strike 
fear into the Knight's, then send in your army to finish them off.
                   Feal-thas, Commander of the White Dragonarmy

              Soiling the Solace Fountain -- by Shammgod Dravehorn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The fountain of Solace is not a place to bathe and urinate.  I know 
after a long day of walking and fighting the free flowing fountain of 
Solace is an inviting place to perform ones bodily functions.  I myself 
admit to such things when nobody else is around.
  The reason why I bring this up is because of a personal experience.  
After a long and hard journey I found my waterskin empty and my throat 
parched.  I slowly made my way to the fountain of Solace, completely 
exhausted.  Being so thirsty I desperately decided to slake my thirs
by taking a long sip of what I thought to be clean water from the 
fountain.  I was abhorred to find the taste of urine in the water.  I 
quickly dropped my waterskin, and ran to Omar's Grocer to purchase 
another one.  Since then, I try no longer to drink from the fountain of 
Solace, but go elsewhere.  It, however, does not have to be this way, 
Crystalmyr Lake is very close by and is a very good place to bathe, and 
the lobsters and turtles do not mind.

           The Age of Dragons:  Past, Present and Future -- by Takhisis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I guess in introduction I would like to state a few things.  First
of all I'd like to thank everyone, both players and staff who have
contributed to AoD making it the excellent mud that it is, and has
always been.  I would like to state that everything I am about to say
in this editorial are my own views, and while I will try to keep them
general, none of them should be viewed as the words of anyone but 
myself.  I do not speak for the entire mud at any point.  Finally, I
would like to say that most of what I am about to write is coming from
the top of my head.  Some of it may be not be 100% correct.  
  With that said, I'll give a general outline of the editorial.  To be
discussed are the history of Age of Dragons (hereafter referred to as
AoD), my own reasons for playing here, brief summaries of AoD's three
"lives", and then a short section on what our plans are for the future.
  To start it off, I'll explain what I know of AoD's beginnings.  The
mud was initially created by Gilean, Solinari (then Paladine), 
Raistlin, the original Takhisis and the original Kiri-Jolith.  They had
all come from the same mud, where they were unhappy in how it was run.
This is a large reason why there are so many muds out there in fact,
and we can all be thankful for thier intolerance.

  With the idea of creating a new mud where they could control how 
things were run, they set out the original plans for Age of Dragons.
The Dragonlance theme was chosen for many reasons.  First and foremost,
it is one that they had personal interest in, knew well and were 
comfortable with.  But the effect it would have on the mud and it's 
players was important too.  Dragonlance is a well known and popular 
theme, thus the players will be able to enjoy it fully, and will be 
able to role play their characters better since their knowledge is 
greater.  But above all, Dragonlance has incredible potential as the
ultimate epci scenario.  The battle between good and evil has a strong
weight on the atmosphere and there is plenty of room for originality.
Their choice was a good one, and we plan on taking it to the fullest 
extent in all our work, whether it be programming, building zones or
running quests.
  My own history with Age of Dragons is as long and detailed as any 
mudders, so I'll spare you the majority of it.  I also came from the
same mud that the other guys had, although I did not know them at the 
time.  I was not impressed by the atmosphere that this other mud 
provided.  There were rarely people around, and when there were, the 
only things ever spoken were out of character and about experience or 
equipment.  Somehow I had gotten the address of AoD, and liking 
Dragonlance myself, I thought to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  
Instantly I was impressed by the atmosphere of role playing and of 
Krynn itself.  The mud itself was lightyears behind the previous one in 
code and zones, but still it was more fun to play.  That is proof alone 
that it truly is atmosphere that makes a mud.

  I'd like to think I've had an impact on AoD as a mortal.  I had only 
played with any amount of seriousness in AoD I, after that most of my 
time was spent as an immortal.  But Many of my characters, I do believe 
had a large impact on the mud.  They had organised the Knights of 
Solamnia, the Conclave of Wizards, and one was also the first regular 
pkiller on AoD (and I'm probably tooting my own horn here, but possibly 
one of the most notorious as well).  In any case, I found it so very 
easy to get into the mud on more than a hack and slash nature.  I spent 
a lot of time, not even adventuring, but sitting at the fountain and 
role playing with many others who did the same thing.  This atmosphere 
is not nearly so prominent as it used to be, and the most frusterating
thing is we don't know why.  However, be assured that we have every 
intention of returning this atmosphere again.
  Age of Dragons I is the one I am most familiar with.  We only had two 
renting cities, Palanthas and a dwarven city named Palbardin.  But we 
managed to have a lot of fun at the same time.  I think that one of the 
most important things was that we had a group of people that played 
with the best intentions of the mud in mind, even when they were 
fighting each other.  We had pretty much less of everything in those 
days, but it was easily the most fun "version" of AoD that we had.  And
I really think it had a lot to do with the player attitude at the time.

  AoD II was a great accomplishment for us, I believe.  I wasn't around 
too much for it, but we had an amazing world structure set up.  The 
epic scenario was truly put into action as the players were seperated 
into good and evil factions in the cities of Palanthas and Sanction.  
The role playing had improved from the ending days of AoD I, although 
to some extent the player attitude had diminished.  However, it was a 
definite example of our progress and potential.  Then the file 
corruption came and it was all gone.
  Starting over again, and from scratch except for an ancient backup of 
the code, we came into AoD III, our present version.  We had decided to
start in the town of Solace.  It had nostalgic merit as the home of the
companions, and also a well developed area around it for future zones. 
 It also gave us a change of pace, as well as for our old players.  
This version of AoD has definitely been differint.  Many of our old 
players would say it isn't as good, and I have to admit myself that 
there is something lacking as well.  It's definitely atmosphere.  
Solace was a good change of pace, but unfortunately we don't have the 
same player and immortal attitude as we did back in AoD I, when we had 
a single starting city.  Role playing has been pretty good though, 
although I'm sure we'd all like to see some more interstig things 
happen.

  I guess this takes us into our plans for the future.  Well, there's 
so many plans I don't even know where to start.  As far as the physical 
world goes, you can definitely look forward to seeing something more 
similar to AoD II.  Sanction and Palanthas are in the works now and 
will completed pretty soon.  The world will eventually be huge.  From 
flying citidals, to the Minotaur Isles, to Ergoth and Mt. Nevermind, to 
the cursed lands of Kendermore to the Bloodsea of Istar.  Who knows, 
maybe even someday we'll invent a time travelling device and create a 
pre-cataclysm Krynn as well for people to play in.  
  As far as our ideas for coding, we've got more than we know what to 
do with.  Many of our plans are posted on the OOC board, where they 
will remain until they are coded, so please refer to them.  But also 
you can expect to see differint classes for each clerical faith as well 
as for each mage robe.  They will have differint spell selection, and 
possibly unique skills as well.  Racial abilities will be implemented, 
we aren't sure how to balance this yet, but it's definitely on the 
drawing board.  And there are literally dozens of spells and skills 
that we have in plans for coding.  It's simply a matter of time.
  In summary, we've done much to try and make this mud as good as it 
can be, and we thank you for your support and for enjoying the mud that 
we've made.  All we can really tell you is watch out for the future 
because it's gonna blow the past out of the water. :)

 Kender:  Tricky Thieves or Cheerful Children?  --  by Kaeman Tareno
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  It has been said by some that the streets of Solace suffer a scourge.  
Not of monsters, or of mages, but of tiny thieves with topknots and 
pouches.  Kender are in Solace,  things keep disappearing, and nobody 
is sure of what to do.  Kill them on sight?  Ask them to leave?  Put 
bells on their necks so we can here them coming?  Or accept that it is 
in their nature to "borrow" things, and learn to watch our belongings?
  There are various players in this little melodrama.  The kender, of 
course, deny stealing anything.  They claim to have happened upon any 
number of trinkets lying on the ground or hidden under rocks.  Any 
attempt to convince them that their actions are unacceptable is met 
with a good raspberry at best, or more theft.
  The non-kender population of Solace is split into two groups.  There 
are those, spearheaded by many prominent Knights of Solamnia, who deem 
the kender as cute little children, who can't help what they do.  
Forgive and forget is their motto, since the kender usually give 
whatever they took back, there is no harm done.

           The Status of the Knights of Takhisis -- by Kaeman Tareno
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  In the past weeks the Knights of Takhisis have been sorely pressed.  
The loss of Ephiny Ananke, and Lilith d'Harrowaene, coupled with the 
disappearance of Uther Uglakar cut their ranks to the ground.  A sense 
of despair had infiltrated the group, and at times it seemed close to 
disbanding.
  Recently, however, things have changed.  Increased activity by all 
members has left the Knights with an awesome armory as well as Knights 
who are able to withstand almost any foe.  A more intense worship of 
The Dragon Queen, Takhisis, has increased the spiritual fiber of the 
entire organization, and recruitment of several new squires has 
increased their depleted ranks.  And amidst the vibrant growth returns 
the Lord of the Skull, Ephiny.  For reasons unknown to most of the 
group, but sanctioned by Takhisis, Ephiny has returned to her position 
stronger than ever.
  The Knights of Takhisis remain a strong presence in Solace, and will 
continue to do so.  Standing for honor, justice, and the Queen they 
continually protect the fair city from the rampages of monsters, 
barbarians, and rampant chickens.  And they will continue to do so as 
long as they are able.  Or, of course, until the Queen says otherwise
Submit, or Die!

                Kender Defense - By Avin "Chigger" Homespun
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  There's been some civil complaints about the entire kender race in 
Solace.  Since I have some experience in the area of self-
justification, I decided to take up the pen for all kender-kind.  
First, Mr. Minotaur, I've been invited to the mansion of the Govenor of 
Solace, who important ever asked you to come to Solace?  (Smelly barn-
yard, muscle-brained, big-as-the-barn-itself, grass-eating, head-like-
a-coat-rack bumblers, you have to show them their place.)
  Now, about the personal property issue.  Did you ever notice how many
"my's" and "from me's" are in those complaints?  These people making 
all that arguing and hissing over worthless items are the most self-
centered, have-a-banana--I-want-an-apple, loud-mouthed, sword-swinging, 
tall persons in the town.  They aren't the nice friendly citizens you 
see in the streets, but they run to the city and make a bunch of noise 
and for what? To get an entire people group exterminated?  That's 
genocide and jollycide and short-people destructive and all-around 
hurtful and kick-the-dog mean and really just no fun.

  Next I want to let all you good people know how much you want kender 
in your town.  One, they find all kinds of lost stuff, in fact that 
lost and found box at Otik's is the biggest kender hang out in the 
city.  Two, they can tell great stories, did you ever hear what a non-
kender thinks is interesting?  Three, if you accidentally lock your 
keys inside your house, a kender can easily pick your lock.  Four, if 
you need help fighting that black dragon, a kender wont leave your 
side.   Five, if you need a map of a new place, I have tons in what I 
like to call my atlas.  Six, well I'm sure there's more stuff, but you 
just have to know one to love one.

           Trash, Trash Everywhere -  By Xergon the Minotaur
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Solace has a problem.  A problem with garbage.  Everyone seems to 
think that it is acceptable to leave their trash everywhere.  I was 
walking down Vallenwood Lane the other day and I could barely avoid 
goring my foot on a sword left laying in the road.  When I arrived at 
the town square, I found bread thrown down in large piles everywhere.  
This mindless litter has to stop.  Solace square used to be a lot 
cleaner before people began dropping their old equipment and food 
everywhere.  It doesn't help that all those tree huggers bring hordes 
of animals into the square and let them soil the ground.  The place 
just stinks!  Maybe the litter problem is caused by the lack of proper 
trash receptacles.  Maybe people are just to lazy to sell there used 
equipment.  All I know is that the whole town reeks.  I am sick of 
getting out of bed and being greeted by the smell of rotting bread.  
his writer say "Pick up you Trash!"

                        Unsafe Passage -- by Kaeman Tareno
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  A travesty is taking place every day in our quite neck of the woods.  
Every day, dozens of people travelling from Solace to the Thelgaard 
Keep risk life and limb crossing what should be a relatively safe 
stretch of ocean.  The reason?  A greedy Dockmaster refuses to take the 
time and the money to repair or replace the cramped, leaking boat that 
currently acts as a ferry.
  Passengers are forced to deal with a slow ride, cramped quarters, and 
a slow leak in the bottom of the boat, which they are required to bail 
themselves if they want to survive the trip.  At any moment pirates, 
storms or even a large fish could most likely capsize the boat, leaving 
its occupants floundering in the sea.  In addition, the bottom of the 
boat could give way at any time, sending it straight to the bottom.
  When asked, the Dockmaster had nothing to say about these safety
concerns other than that if people didn't like it, they could stay
home.  We encourage anyone travelling to Thelgaard to stop and lodge a 
complaint with a great enough response we may be able to prevent a 
tragic accident at sea from happening.

                 An Adventure in Que-Shu -- by Celena Cairebirth
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I have only just awoken after a most interesting tale that took place 
in the Que-Shu village a ways from Solace.  I was out adventuring with 
Karth and a elf I had only just met named Darkonon.  it was an 
interesting day as we happened to be walking amongst the dwellings and 
tents.  When a friend of Darkonon's by the name of Johnalith, joined 
our group.  Quite an intriguing fellow I must say.  Well to bring the 
tale further along, I was studying my spell book as we walked.  Blessed 
Lunitari having left me once more in the dark, forsaking me and my 
magic, when we heard shouts from one of the tents.
  Karth had intrigued a archer to join us so we approached cautiously, 
only to find a dispute in place between a elf and some Que-Shu 
tribesman.  The elf appeared to be at the point of drawing steel or 
perhaps it was the tribesman.  A girl can never be to sure of these 
things when blood runs heated among men and we saw that we must jump in 
and do something.  So as Karth ordered us all behind him and the archer 
we burst into the room.  I fear I may have closed my eyes or forgotten 
where I was for a few minutes as I stuffed my spellbook into my pouch 
and prepared to assist in any way I could.

  The next thing I know they all are jumping at us.  And low and 
behold, Johnalith had jumped in front of the archer and Karth to 
protect the elf, who seemed hell bent on cutting us down and before we 
could stop our blades, Johnalith was on the floor, grievously hurt and 
Karth was holding his head yelling for me and Darkonon to flee as he 
was blind.  Confused as I was in the mess, I ran to Karth to assure him 
he was safe and that Darkonon was holding the tribesman at bay and had 
dispatched the elf.  And quickly I tried to see to Johnalith's wounds 
and low and behold he started to come around.  As we helped him refix 
his gear, he healed himself before my very eyes and we dispatched the 
quarrelsome tribesmen and sought to find the crux of the quarrels in 
the small village, helping Johnalith until he was strong enough on 
his own.
  Well this one can say, when you surround yourself with strong men, 
life certainly can be interesting.  it seems Johnalith in his 
excitement and poor visibility had taken the other elf for someone he 
knew and his robes had caught on a loose table and hence he wound up in 
the milieu.  Lunitari in the heavens I have never had some much 
laughter or frightful fun in an afternoon.

       Death in Both Hands: An Interview with Rush -- Anonymous
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  A sharp dressed man stalks the streets of Solace.  Known only as 
Rush, the premier assassin in the area.  We managed to track down Rush 
for this interview, and asked about his life, his work, and his recent 
feud with various organizations in Solace.
INTERVIEWER:
Well, I suppose I'll start with the question everyone  wants answered:  
what made you start in this business?
RUSH:
I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't kill people except in 
self defense.
INTERVIEWER:
What about this recent feud you're alleged to be having with Elisan and 
his gang?
RUSH:
Well, it was as much news to me as to the rest of the world.  I heard 
they were looking for me in connection with the killings of Elisan and 
the mage Karth.  I had nothing to do with them, of course, but no 
interested parties seem to believe me.

INTERVIEWER:
But isn't it true you had in your possession several items that could 
only have come from Elisan or Karth?  And isn't it also true that Karth 
himself identified you upon resurrection?
RUSH:
Look, I said I didn't do it.  That's all there is to it.  I don't know 
what motives Karth had for lying about who killed him, and I still say 
that the ring was planted.
INTERVIEWER:
But isn't it also true witnesses saw you and Elisan arguing just a few 
days before he was killed? Something about him calling you a "has been 
assassin?"
RUSH:
I had nothing to do with any of this.  This interview is over, I 
suggest you leave. Now.
INTERVIEWER:
But what about the other evidence?  The blood trail?  The *urk*
  An eagle eyed reporter makes a strange sound but is suddenly very 
silent.
Someone places a sharp, pointy object in his back..
An eagle eyed reporter is dead!  R.I.P.
Your blood freezes as you hear an eagle eyed reporter's death cry.
  Note:  The views of the reporter are not views held by the staff or 
editors of this paper.  Really, we believe Rush to be innocent and want 
no quarrel with him of any kind.  We firmly believe the death of our 
reporter to be a strange accident.  Fear Nothing, Life is a Rush.

both your short and long term goals.  Now is the time to win friends 
and influence people.  Do not hesitate in being brazen and shameless to
achieve those goals.  Focus on your most intruiging social connections.
Do not let such happenings drift past you if you normally would.  Be

who play important roles in the things that you, yourself find

prepare you for greater assignment and more profound happiness in the
future.  Suprisingly, perhaps the most effective affirmation is that
surrender can make you more potent in ways you cannot presently

New ideas start to push through your present state of mind, accept them
and look into them.  If you are truly doing what you love to do, then
you will meet with a great deal of success.  The various parts of
your personality that co-exist but do not co-operate will start to make
peace with each other and your psyche will settle down some.  Do not be

little bit of slack.  Perhaps it is time act correctly, not to be a
slave to correct actions.  Throw a little bit of a zig zag into the
courses of your life that seem like straight lines.  One aspect to
focus on are the sounds that escape your mouth.  Begin to put a little
questioning into your voice.  There's really no more need to be

  Metaphorically, you symbolise the mages golem.  Protective and
obedient you are to those you love and trust, but at other times clumsy
and naive.  Unless kept on a tign rein, you are likely to run amok and
accidentally mess up that which you intend to assist.  At the present
time, this relation is very close to your own situation.  In your
recent past, you have created within yourself somethin similar to a
golem of the above sort, and it's almost ready to go out on it's own.
If you wield an iron hand on keeping this golem focused on your highest
ideals, it will aid you quite a bit in the coming months.  If not, you
could find yourself in a hole that you had dug yourself out of some
time ago, and once again find yourself climbing back up to solid

  The next few months promise to throw many wrenches into the gears of
your everyday life.  Most of the time, these shocking occurances will
prove to be rather friendly, if not sometimes unsettling.  However, one
must be careful, for unless dealt with carefully, good changes can oft
be as stressful as bad ones.  Akin to the platinum dragon believes in
order and structure, you must betray this trait at times, and follow
a more rowdy sense of being in order to be flexable enough to weather
all the necessary adjustments.  As long as you place love as your
highest priority, these things could pass by entirely unnoticed.  Even
those of the dark hearts take heed, for love can suit the purposes of
all beings of all natures.

  The attention that you have been giving to others could now do far
more good to both yourself and those around you if instead it was
pointed to you.  Start treating yourself as you would the man or woman
that you have always dreamed of.  Give gifts, bestow praise, fling
flirtatious comments.  As strange as it sounds, a little bit of self-
spoiling could really turn around the more doubtful aspects of your
life.

The haze is beginning to fade and the walls are starting to crumble.
Make sure to take advantage of this lucky break.  For you can either

     A Brief History on the Towers of High Sorcery -- by Finn Dantilus
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note from Author:
The are now only two Towers of High Sorcery on Krynn. One is the Tower 
in Wayreth and the other one is the Tower of Palanthas.
  Towers: The Towers were built by magic-users who used their magic to 
pull pure rock from the bones of the planet. There was five Towers in 
the beginning: The Tower of Wayreth, the Tower of Palanthas, the Tower 
in the Ruins, the Tower of Istar, and the Tower of Daltigoth. All 
Towers had their own way of defending their secrets.
  Tower of Wayreth: The Tower of Wayreth became the main point of magic
on Krynn after the Cataclysm, which destroyed the Tower of Istar. The 
Tower's first defense is the magical forest of Wayreth, which never 
stayed in one place. The Tower's second defense is a magical shield 
around it that allows it to appear anywhere within 500 miles from its 
original location.
  Tower of Istar: The Tower of Istar was surrounded by a /forget/ 
spell. though rumored lost, made the intruder lose all of its memory 
once it entered the area that the spell was cast. He/she forgot his/her 
name, spells, where they were, how to use a sword. Meaning everything 
that had happened in their life.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tower of Palanthas: The Tower of Palanthas was originally made pearly 
white and beautiful though made of by magic. The mages were forced to 
leave it so they took their books and other important items to the 
Tower of Wayreth. As legend goes the gates had just been locked and was 
about to be given to the mayor of Palanthas when a Black Robed jumped 
from the pathway (now known as Death Path) onto the gates piercing his 
body and causing his blood to flow onto the gates. In his last dying 
breath he cast a spell on the Tower: "Only when the Master of the 
Present and the Past returns with power shall the gate open." Around 
the Tower Shokian Grove grew. Shokian Grove had an overwhelmingly 
powerful /fear/ spell cast on it, causing people of all races to run 
from the Tower in fear, it was so powerful that its power reached well 
beyond the Grove itself.
(Fear Spell: This spell causes extreme feelings of fear in a person 
removing all control and forcing them to put as much distance between 
them and the tower as possible until out of the spell area)
Note: More information is available in a book titled, "The History of 
Magic" also authored by Finn Dantilus and available at the local 
libraries.

The Statue and the Sickle -- by Golwyn Ambrose, Nightlord of the Thorn
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  It was a day of celebration for the Knights of Takhisis.  Lady 
Ephiny, Lord of the Skull, had returned to the Knights after taking 
part in Takhisis' test of the Knights.  In the midst of these 
celebrations they orb atop my holy staff of thorns began to glow.  As I 
looked into the glowing crystal I saw deep inside the Temple of 
Chemosh.
 I watched as yellow skulled followers of the Lord of the Dead were 
chanting at the base of a mammoth statue of Chemosh.  Towards the end 
of their ceremony the high priest placed in the hand of the statue a 
sickle.  This huge sickle looked as though it could cut a man in half 
with a single stroke and it was glowing a pale yellow, as is expected 
of a weapon of the undead.
 I knew that the sickle was a rare find indeed and immediately sought 
the assistance of Lord Ephiny and Sir Kaeman to retrieve this item.  We 
were able to bypass many of the underground temple by magically 
portalling to a location close to the statue.  Even with the combined 
strength of the assembled Knights we knew this would be a most 
difficult battle.

 To assist us in battle I used my magical powers to charm two unwitting
Solamic Knights who were training at Thelgaard Keep.  Though these 
knights pale in comparison to the strength and endurance that Sir 
Kaeman possessed, they would be perfect for taking the damage the 
Statue of Chemosh was so willing to inflict on us.
 Using the charmed knights came with a high price, however, because my
enemies are will often attempt to strike at me instead of those who I 
control.  I was, therefore, unable to provide as much assistance as I 
would have liked, in particular was the need to silence that statue to 
prevent it from healing itself.
 We were able to overcome this obstacle through effective use of Lord 
Ephiny's masterful use of summoning Sir Kaeman and, of course, her 
ability to cure wounds with a single word.  It was a long, hard fought 
battle and we triumphed thanks to the impressive leadership of Lord 
Ephiny and the teamwork of the Knights.
 Though the Sickle turned out not to be the most effective weapon for
combat, it has proven useful in enhancing Lord Ephiny's ability to 
memorize her spells.  The victory against the Statue of Chemosh 
demonstrated the renewed strength of the Knights of Takhisis and their 
impenetrable loyalty to the Dragonqueen.

                   The Prophecy of the Dragon
              by Kaeman Tareno, Knight of the Lily
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  I, Kaeman Tareno, do first declare unending loyalty to the Dragon 
Queen, Takhisis, and swear by my honor as a knight in her service that 
what follows is a true accounting of what I have seen, as much as 
dreams and visions can be truly recounted to those who did not 
experience them.  What follows is an excerpt from ancient texts 
concerning the coming of our Queen to the lands of Krynn, as well as a 
vision I experienced concerning the same event. Those who do not follow 
her quake in fear.  The Queen shall come and her power will strike down 
all that oppose her.

  From an ancient text found in an abandoned temple of Paladine:
  And so shall appear a champion of darkness.  Wreathed in shadows and 
cloaked in flame, bearing with him the voice of the dragon, he will 
herald the coming of the Dragon. A hero shall rise before the Dragon, 
bearing a talisman of great power and light.  Three trials shall be set 
before him, that he might stay the Dragon and preserve the light.  The 
first shall be a trial of trust, that he might show the Dragon where 
Her weakness lies, fore the forces of darkness cannot show trust lest 
their comrades consume them.  The second shall be a test of courage, 
such that he will know what it is to face the wrath of the forces of 
darkness, and prove himself the stronger.  The last shall be a test of 
faith, to show that the powers of light can conquer the shadow of 
darkness.  And the hero shall meet the herald of the Dragon, and they 
shall battle.  And on that battle rests the fate of Krynn, fore should 
the hero fall the Dragon will come.  Fire shall burn the land to 
ashes.  Smoke will choke the breath from all who taste the air.  The 
rivers and seas will fill with the blood of all the peoples of the 
land.  And the Dragon, Takhisis, will rule in the Heavens and on Krynn 
for one thousand years, and good will be all but lost.

  From a scroll discovered in the volcanic temples of Sanction:
  And so this lord of darkness will rise, leading the armies of the 
Queen.  He will have no face, for it shall be burned by the Dragons own 
breath.  He shall have no soul, for She will take it from him.  He will 
have no weakness, for he will be imbued with Takhisis' own strength.  
No warrior will stand against his fury.  No shield shall stay his 
mighty sword.  With the fury of the Abyss shall he crush all who oppose 
him.  One shall rise for the forces of light, tried by the Gods of good 
and sent forth as champion.  Fire will rise in the wake of the hero of 
darkness, and the shadow of the Dragon will walk beside him.  He will 
wield the Dragon's tooth and be cloaked in Her scales. The hero of 
light shall carry a talisman of Paladine, glowing with the light of 
good. On a plain of dust under a moon of blood will these titans clash, 
and the world will shake at their meeting.  When the battle is over one 
will remain.  That one shall be the champion of Takhisis.  The forces 
of good will be scattered to the winds and The Dragon Queen shall rule 
on Krynn.  So speak I, Aratine Shadowdark, High Cleric of Takhisis and 
Prophet of the Dragon, granted these visions by Takhisis herself.

  The scroll was coupled with another that described the formula for an 
arcane potion that would allow he who drank it to receive visions from 
Takhisis.. This scroll was lost shortly after I brewed the potion.  I 
have included as much of the procedure as I can recollect, but I 
caution there may be critical elements I have overlooked, and advise 
anyone reading this not to attempt to brew such a concoction, much less 
drink it.
     Ingredients:
            1 part:  The blood of a cockatrice
            1 part:  A scale from an evil dragon, given freely.
            2 part:  The brain of an ogre warrior, slain in battle
            2 part:  Sea salt
            4 part:  Unholy water blessed by Takhisis
  With the help of my friend Artim Parlemaine and a priest of Takhisis 
I set out to brew this elixir.  Once the ingredients were acquired, 
Artim used his magic to create an intense fire, while the priest filled 
a ceremonial bowl with his magical water.  Slowly we stirred the 
ingredients in, the priest chanting to the Queen all the while.  Then 
the mixture was left in the light of Nuitari for a full month of 
nights.  Finally the liquid was buried in the ground for twelve days.  
Then it was ready.  On the night of Nuitari's full phase I was ready to 
imbibe the potion.  With a strange sense of excitement building within 
me, I drank down the foul brew, wondering if I had made some fatal 
error in the process of forming the potion.  As the first pains hit, I 
prepared myself to face my Queen and journey to the Abyss.  But the 
pain subsided, and I sunk into sleep.  I shall now relate to you the 
visions I had that night, visions granted to me by Takhisis herself.  
Visions of the coming of the age of darkness.

  As I opened my eyes it felt as if I was in fact waking from a sleep.  
My first thoughts were that the elixir failed.  But as I looked around 
I saw that I was definitely no longer in my room at the Inn of The Last 
Home.  Gone were the stout vallenwood walls, the polished floors, and 
the comfortable beds.  In their place were volcanoes, pits of fiery 
lava, and multitudes of devilish fiends.  The Abyss.  I was surrounded 
on all sides by huge beasts.  Some looked like crocodiles crossed with 
demons, while others gave off the rotting stench of undeath.  I 
scrambled to my feet, ready to meet my death with steel in hand.  But 
they did not attack.  The ring parted and a woman stepped forward, her 
beauty out of place among the demons.  She was dressed in a flowing 
cape that shifted and flowed around her. Her face was pure white, and 
her eyes shifted from blue to green to red and back. She motioned, and 
I felt myself drawn towards her.
  "So.  You wish to see visions of future times? You desire to see what 
is yet too be?  Very well.  Prepare yourself."
  She waved her hand.  All of the sudden I was flying through the air 
into a cloud of smoke.  When it cleared I hovered over a great 
wasteland.  In the distance a magnificent castle carved from ebony sat 
upon a mountaintop.  Scattered across the plain were bones, thousands 
of bones.  Everywhere fires raged.

  A flash of light and I stood over a pool of molten rock.  A man 
dressed in shining white reached into it, pulling forth a shimmering 
sword of white steel.  He raised it above his head, and with a wordless 
cry plunged it into his own breast.  He looked down.  There was no 
blood rushing from the wound, but light.
  Another flash.  This time it was a mountain I saw.  A dark figure 
trudged up a long path towards the top.  He was cloaked in black, and 
his footsteps melted the very rock.  A cloud of steam rose off him, 
spiraling upwards into the shape of a great dragon.
  A small village lay nestled in a valley, surrounded on all sides by 
hordes of goblins. A mage dressed in red robes stood alone in the 
center of the town, arms weaving in motions of mystical power.  Great 
bolts of fire and lighting struck deeply into the horde, but he was 
overwhelmed and torn apart.  With his death a ghostly cloud descended 
upon the village, and at its touch everything, goblins, houses, the 
ground itself, turned to stone.  
  Finally, all was still and cold.
  Then a shimmering portal was before me.  Constructed of solid silver 
it bent and twisted under the weight of mighty magical forces.  The 
heads of dragons adorned the five corners, twisting and roaring.  A 
strange pulse shot through the portal, then again.  An arm came 
through, delicate and slender. A face began to appear,  black, 
serpentine eyes visible. Then it vanished.I was once again in the 
Abyss.  The lady in black turned to me, and her voice was powerful.

  "You have seen much, but have understood little.  Do not worry.  Only 
know that these things you have seen are my will, and by them I shall 
return to Krynn, to rue eternal."
  She waved her hand and we were surrounded by blackness.
"Wake now, Kaeman Tareno.  Go forth into the world and await my return, 
for with it shall be a new age. An age of power for those who serve 
me."
Once more she motioned, and I was blown backwards, tumbling over and 
over into the darkness.  I awoke with a start, breathing hard and 
sweating.  My mind was full of visions.

cloak silk~
   Quite unlike any other cloaks, this one seems as though wind cannot disturb
it.  No matter how hard the wind blows, the cloak does not billow and gather
and flow with the air.  Fine blue silk, uncut in any place on the fabric, makes
up the entire length of this beautiful cloak.

Careful work has been put into it to ensure that it has been kept in perfect
condition.  Shining kingfishers with wings spread forward adorn the coat as
epulets.
