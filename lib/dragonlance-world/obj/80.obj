letter parchment skin~
   Though dried and torn in places, this parchment made of pale, human skin
seems to still keep it's lettering quite well.  Written upon it in blood red,
elven words is the following letter:
   To my son Uristhantalis,
Not all spirits go to rest my son. In a time of godless ages, I have
only the realm of the mortals to turn to. My soul lies restless still
within the shaded veil of death. The chains of love and hate tear me
in two directions.
In this I have little time to explain, except to say in death's moment
your father and I called upon and cursed all those forgotten gods who
have long since been forgotten and heard no more by mortal ears.  In
this my son, we have payed a terrible price, for in our misery only
the two gods whom we least expect to spend eternity with answered our
cries.
My dearest son, I know you have payed the price for losing us, with
your guilt and now a cold heart, but I beg of you....find a way to
release us of these eternal chains which bind us between the realm
of life and eternal sleep we seek.
Seek out the temples of those gods whom would bind us...there shall
you find the first steps to rescue our souls.
I must go now...the demons whom chase us are near...I pray
ye shall find release for us soon.
Larisania

quiver flaming red heart tree~
   This quiver is made from a strange, flaming red wood.  Obviously magical,
the wood bends and flexes as easily as silk, yet seems to be hard as ironwood.
The swirls of the wood itself seem to spell out strange sigils and runes, all
of which cannot be identified with any currently known runes.  As the quiver
presses against your skin you can almost feel a heartbeat within it filling you
with life, energy, and strangely enough a strange kind of warmth.

suspended from a worn leather strap by a forged hook at it's pinnacle.  A
slight crease circles the radius of the egg, almost suggesting it could be
opened.  Gold letters etched into the sphere read, "In your days of chilling
demeanors and unforgiving carriage, may this egg add some humor and warmth to
your heart.".  Though it seems large when handled, it appears to shrink when
worn.......almost unnoticable.

Swirling colors of blur are in constant motion within the gem, and the single
claw of a raven is grasping it as if to keep its' power in check.  The lineage
of this ring states that a long history of men and women of great power came
into contact with this ring.  One old sage studied it for years, and in his
final scribblings before his passing wrote about it: "The ring is of an
indeterminable past.  While in my person I noticed that I was was imbued with
the agility of a cat, less succeptable to disease, and my sense of perception
seemed to be greatly amplified"

mask~
   For centuries certain sects have used this mask as a coming-of-age

meet the High Druid and prove their devotion.  The mask is carved entirely of
ivory, and a unique pattern which represents the true feelings of the wearer is
drawn upon the face using an extract of the liphinwood root.  These markings
never change as the wearer ages, yet it is rumored in those that go astray from
the path of their sect, upon meeting the High Druid when the mask is removed,
the pattern will be permanantly seared into their skin and will serve as a
lifelong reminder of their lack of commitment.

with green and black scales which glitter when wet like a pile of dark ore does
under the starfilled sky.  His piercing eyes are the shade of a Theiwar mined
Ruby, and miss nothing yet never seem to move.  His temperment is calm, yet his
razor-sized fangs could strike quickly if he gets startled.  If he is truly
upset, he takes pleasure in coiling round his victims, squeezing the body till
every bone breaks, and then swallowing the body whole.

dagger tapered keenly long~
   The dagger before you posesses a thirteen inch blade, and a wickedly razor sharp edge.
The hilt of the weapon is as long as the width of the average mans hand, and seems to
have a very custom shape to it, as that it would only feel right in one perticular persons
hand.
   Upon closer examination of the dagger, you notice small engravings about the base of
the blade, which seemed to have been of a common tongue, but have worn down
to the point that they cannot be read. In addition, on the very bottom of the hilt,
is inset with a brilliant, almost luminescent green jewel.

Wars.  During that time period, many valiant dragons gave up their lives in
fighting for just cause.  It was not unusual for mages to come across the
bodies of these magnificient creatures and gather the componets needed for
spellcasting.  This particular claw comes from a great silver whom gave her
life in the service of Paladine.  Her mortal friend, a white mage, cast upon
the claw enchantments of great power which only one of pure heart and soul may
ever utilize.
