glaive orange hued steel flaming~
   This long, two-handed slashing weapon is ideal for distance combat.  When
used in proper ranks, the effects can be devastating.  The glaive itself is
made of an orange-hued steel and bursts flames from the blade of the weapon.  
Unlike most glaives, the pole is made of a lightweight steel, and is shaped
with hand grips in the appropriate places.

cannon craech~
   This large piece of machinery looks rather complicated and is almost
certainly gnomish technology.  Metal tubes connect at all angles all over the
cannon, weaving to and fro.  Strange runes have been painted on the sides as
well, suggesting there is more to this item than gnomish befuddlement.  The
huge muzzle of the cannon point out of the tower and at the base of it you can
see a small screw-top cover.
