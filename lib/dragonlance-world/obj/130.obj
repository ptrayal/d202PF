ancient radiant bastard sword serpentine hilt life bane~
   This ancient bastard sword has been crafted from a cold-blue steel.  The
blade itself emits a brilliant radiance, though not of a magical sort.  The
strange serpentine handle has been crafted from flawless ivory and mithril, and
a soft vermilion cover has been placed around it for gripping purposes.  How
this elaborate astral blade came into existance is unknown.  At the base of the
hilt lies an eerie sigil of a faded yellow skull.

In early spring, year 153 A.C. two brothers and a sister formed a powerful 
alliance that would be known as "The Clenched Fist". These brothers and their 
sister were Durath, Artharoth, and Caycee Shilluk. The Shilluk name was both 
respected, and feared in the city of Tarsis. Durath, the initial founder of 
The Clenched Fist was a former Captain of the Guard for the city, and both his
brother Artharoth and sister Caycee sat upon the council. The time was during
the Age of Despair, and as their answer to the Seeker movement (a group of
people following new, false gods) they decided to form this Clan to regain
faith and worshipfulness to the old gods.
During a supposed attack on Tarsis from Solamnic spies, Durath, Artharoth, and
Caycee rose to the occasion and defended the once beautiful city from the 
wretched Solamnics. Durath was granted the title "The Tarsian Warlord" by the
governor, Artharoth and Caycee were both granted the titles "The Tarsian Hero"
and "The Tarsian Defender" respectively. After their victory, Durath suggested
they continue to lay waste upon the evil Solamnic knights, whom were responsible
for bringing the Cataclysm down on Tarsis. The Clenched Fist was formed, and the
primary god of worship was Misal-Lasim, the Dark God of War and Vengeance,
otherwise known as Sargonnas.

page2~
The Clenched Fist waged war on the Solamnic Knights for ages, gaining respect,
and striking fear into the hearts of their foes. They eventually established a
small stronghold between Solace and Haven, and then shortly afterwards Durath
was named Mayor of Solace. In his old age, Durath had begun to forgive the
Solamnics for their evil deeds, and at one point even traveled to Palanthas to
aid a group of Solamnic Knights in their battle against an other-worldly air 
elemental. However, due to treachery once again by the Solamnic Knights, Durath
grew bitter and swore to once again eliminate the Knights of Solamnia and anyone
who supported or harbored them.
In approximately year 201 A.C. Durath suddenly disappeared. Word had spread that
Durath, as Mayor of Solace, had began a movement to form an alliance with 
Verminaard, the Highlord of the Red Dragon Army. Many suspected he had traveled 
to Sanction, but less than a week afterwards, Caycee received a letter from a
courier. The letter was written by Durath himself, and he explained to Caycee that
he had been captured, and was soon to be executed. He never gave any specific
details about who, or what had captured him, however. Shortly after the death of
Durath, The Clenched Fist began to crumble and die as well. Caycee had grown ill,
and Artharoth had been recruited by the Dragon Armies. Less than a year later,
The Clenched Fist was no more.
Page2, continue with Page3
~
E
page3~
It is now year 357 A.C. - the late spring. After thorough research, another young
group of souls have decided to revive The Clenched Fist. Finding all ancient 
guidelines for the clan, over a century and a half later The Clenched Fist movement
has again gone underway. They have planned a continuation of the siege of Solamnia, 
and they have already began recruitment.  Now, The Clenched Fist not only pays
homage to Sargonnas, but also to Chemosh, Takhisis, Hiddukel, and Nuitari. They have
broadened into this myriad of gods in order to gain more followers, thus increasing
the power of their clan. The Clenched Fist lives again, yet another fierce and 
powerful alliance of destruction.

Under the hills the heart of the axe
Arises from cinders the still core of the fire,
Heated and hammered the handle an afterthought,
For the hills are forging the first breath of war.
The soldier's heart sires and brothers
The battlefield.
Come back in glory
Or on your shield.
Out of the mountains in the midst of the air
The axes are dreaming dreaming of rock,
The metal alive through the ages of ore,
Stone on metal metal on stone.
The soldier's heart contains and dreams
The battlefield.
Come back in glory
Or on your shield.
Red of iron imagined from the vein,
Green of brass green of copper
Sparked in the fire the forge of the world,
Consuming in its dream as it dives into bone.
The soldier's heart lies down, completes
The battlefield.
Come back in glory
Or on your shield.

Then let his shade to Huma rise
Out of the body of death, of the husk unraveling;
From the lodging of the mind upon nothing, 
We are thankful to you,
Lord Huma, deliver him.
Beyond the wild, impartial skies
Have you set your lodgings,
In cantonments of stars, where the sword aspires
In an arc of yearning, where we join in singing.
Return this man to Huma's breast
Beyond the wild, impartial skies;
Grant to him a warrior's rest
And set the last spark of his eyes
Free from the smothering clouds of wars,
Upon the torches of stars.
Let the last surge of his breath
Take refuge in the cradling air
Above the dreams of ravens, where
Only the hawk remembers death.
Then let his shade to Huma rise,
Beyond the wild, impartial skies.

Upon the torches of stars
Was mapped the immaculate glory of childhood;
From that wronged and nestling country,
Lord Huma, deliver him.
Let the last surge of his breath
Perpetuate wine, attar of flowers;
From the vanguard of love, the last to surrender,
Lord Huma, deliver him.
Take refuge in the cradling air
From the heart of the sword descending,
From the weight of battle on battle;
Lord Huma, deliver him.
Above the dreams of ravens where
His dreams first tried a rest beyond changing,
From the yearning for war and the war's ending,
Lord Huma, deliver him.
Only the hawk remembers death
In a late country; from the dusk,
From the fade of the senses, we are thankful that you,
Lord Huma, deliver him.

Return this man to Huma's breast:
Let him be lost in sunlight,
In the chorus of air where breath is translated;
At the sky's border receive him.
Beyond the wild, impartial skies
Have you set your lodgings,
In cantonments of stars, where the sword aspires
In an arc of yearning, where we join in singing.
Grant to him a warrior's rest.
Above our singing, above song itself,
May the ages of peace converge in a day,
May he dwell in the heart of Paladine.
And set the last spark of his eyes
In a fixed and holy place
Above words and the borrowed land too loved
As we recount the ages.
Free from the smothering clouds of war
As he once rose in infancy,
The long world possible and bright before him,
Lord Huma, deliver him.

compendium shagreen well worn~
This book has been written in an ancient Solamnic style of handwriting, but is
written clearly enough to be understood easily. The untanned shagreen leather
that binds the book is of exceptional quality, and the grained surface has done
an excellent job of protecting it over the years.  The opening page reads:
                       {The Solamnic Death Chant}
