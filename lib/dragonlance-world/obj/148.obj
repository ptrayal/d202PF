founder of the U'pschyt family, while he was adventuring in the mountains south
of blode, where he and his fellows came upon an abandoned cave once inhabited
by a red dragon.  The dragon however used the cave as a storage chamber and did
not dwell within.  When the dragon found its treasure looted from her hiding
place she sought revenge and hunted down every member of the adventurin party,
killing them one by one and reclaiming her trinkets.  The only one to escape
her wrath was the patriarch of the U'pschyt family who went into reclusion, and
in doing so settled a small farming comunity with his friend Aken D'aurgoth.

by Takhisis, this well worn breastplate has not one tarnishment or dent upon
it's surface.  The metal used in its forging is colorless, and the end result
is that it seems to suck up the light around it, perhaps empowering it in some
fashion not yet revealed to the wearer.  Adorning the metal near the base of
the neck piece, nine black pearls have been placed in a pattern of the five
headed dragon of Takhisis.

inscription pendant~
   Once the proud symbol of the Descartes merchant family, this sapphire
pendant serves as a constant reminder of failure.  Crafted by the skilled hands
of the Silvenesti elves as a gift to the founder of the Descartes, the pendant
has been bestowed with ancient magic of the elven kingdom.  Upon close
inspection the proud falcon adorning the pendant appears to be shedding a tear,
perhaps for betrayel done.

   Cured human skin, fashioned into the darkest leather and embossed with

Ansalon following the catalysm, and nearly all destroyed.  Items such as these
however have a way of resurfacing throughout the years, and the bearers of
these dark relics often do remarkable deeds, dark evil deeds, but remarkable
all the same.

inscription ring~
   Upon this ring the stag and bow of the U'pschyt family crest has been
engraved upon it.  The ring is said to have been found generations ago by the
founder of the U'pschyt family, while he was adventuring in the mountains south
of blode, where he and his fellows came upon an abandoned cave once inhabited
by a red dragon.  The dragon however used the cave as a storage chamber and did
not dwell within.  When the dragon found its treasure looted from her hiding
place she sought revenge and hunted down every member of the adventurin party,
killing them one by one and reclaiming her trinkets.  The only one to escape
her wrath was the patriarch of the U'pschyt family who went into reclusion, and
in doing so settled a small farming comunity with his friend Aken D'aurgoth.
