   Respected High Priestess of Takhisis, It is my honor to be the first to
congradulate you on your recent victory.  The battle you endeavored was quite
drawn out, but you stood beside Commander Dax from start to finish.  I know
that I made no mistake by asking you and Dax to join the White Dragonarmies and
move into Icewall Castle.  I thank you for your honor, loyality and your
powerful blessings from The Dark Queen.  Respectfully, Feal-Thas, Dragon High
Lord Of The White Dragonarmies
