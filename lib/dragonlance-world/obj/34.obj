sabre long black que hep~
   This fantasticly worked sabre is well over four feet in length, most of it
taken up by the extremely sharp, black steel blade.  Due it it's length, you
would think it would handle rather badly, but in fact it is excellently
balanced, and you cut the air with it effortlessly with a loud swoosh.
