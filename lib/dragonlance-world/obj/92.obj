rolled piece parchment~
@Y
Unfurling the parchment, it reads:

Kalik,

You are to have your men excavate this tunnel, and store our weapons
and armor here for now.  We will be sending more men shortly, but for
now we need you to excavate this cave until it is large enough to hold
at least 3 talons of men.  Lord Cambal wants this island to be the
staging grounds for our operation here in Palanthas, while Ariaken and
his men train to the north.  Remember... your job, once this base is
established, is to make quick strikes at palanthas by night.  Our allies
in Palanthas will make sure our talons can get in, so the you will not
have to worry about that.  I will be sending some our finest Kapak
assassins as well, though for the time being they will be located at our
secondary base.  For now, I will remain in hiding in the village,
directing things from there.  Do not seek me out, I will get word to
you whenever there is need.

Do not fail me,

Commander Galik
