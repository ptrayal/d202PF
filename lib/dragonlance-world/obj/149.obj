charred~
The sign appears to be burnt beyond repair, but the words can still be recognized:
   Let this be a warning, the monsters beyond this portal are some of the strongest
monsters you'll face in Krynn. They are ruthless and will do anything to take your
life. The rewards are equal to the risk, enjoy your death.

pantaloons~
   Timelessly crafted from the finest silk, these turquoise pants resemble
craftsmanship not seen around Krynn in ages.  Silk of this quality is rare,
only used in the wardrobe of the noble class due ot its extreme cost.  A faint
glow can be seen coming from them, though you are unsure if it is a result of
the light hitting the silk a certain way or froms ome mysterious magic.
