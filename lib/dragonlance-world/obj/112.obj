Watching as the sky turns a red,
No attention to what was said,
And as they come up from below,
Like evil things, they seem to grow.
At the Tower, they do arise,
Not caring as they hear the cries.
The son of one, he knows what's right,
So he ventures to leave the blight
Which the creatures, they call their home.
Over the lands, he goes to roam.
He holds the Trident of Power,
They look at him with a glower,
He looks back, subordinates them.

He scopes the land, his eyes flicker.
Walking through the lands with hunger.
Drawing the Trident with fervor,
Gaining power to be stronger.
He hunts for deer to sate his self.
There's one beyond the higher shelf.
Tossing the Trident like a spear...
He punctures the heart of the deer.
He'll rise ahead, to fall behind
For madness will take up his mind.
I know, for the weapon was cursed,
Insanity, too, took the first.
But for now, he is not insane.
There are the drops which signal rain.
He will be King of all those things,
But now they wait for what he brings.

Each town he takes up on his own,

True, no normal daemon is he,
He can do what can thirty-three.
A mighty reign he sets to rule,
Does this alone, he is no fool.
His wisdom comes from his green Gem.
And the lowers, he controls them.
His birth was heralded through time,
To be born of the greatest line,
To be the one to lead them all
After the daemons' greatest fall.
To bring them back, to rise above,
He is the killer of the Dove.
He needed only one more piece
To make all of the visions cease.

The Crown of Kings he needed now
From the bones of a mighty cow.
How disgusting this may sound here,
But the Crown emanated fear.
He was born to find this foul thing,
To wield the power it would bring.
To slay the humans that he face,
Maybe even to end their race.
Humans named him Apocalypse,
His own people called him Eclipse.
For he shall cover the foul sun,
End this age, bring on a new one,
Get rid of all technology
Only cavern life will there be.
The Crown, power over all souls,
Is said to have played many roles.

He is to cause this to happen.
He'll hold the power of Creations,
Destroying each race that he shuns.
There once was born a knightly man,
Could slay three goblins with one hand.
Owned the most on the King's estate,
But he was depressed as of late.

Followed promise to the letter.
On battle field, he showed great skill.
There seemed nothing he could not kill.
Then there came a wrong in his ways.
He changed and did shun the Sun's rays.
In his body, there was no good,
This came with what's over his hood.
A Crown he found, ancient treasure.

The Daemon King, he heard of this,
Though on arrival, he did kiss
The feet of this uncouth human,
Who was alone, and never ran.
The melancholy had reached him,
The cold feeling utterly grim.
So he could do naught, but to bow.
To be partners, he did there vow.
The two of them, horrible team,
Unlike a fabric, there's no seam,
They slew the faeries, useless race,
Erased them from the planet's face.
And other missions did they win.
And in their rule, there was no sin.
But each had plans for at the end;
Each other's body would each rend.

Roch, the Knight, wanted the Trident,
So followed where the daemon went.
Eclipse would wear the Crown one day,
And then this human would he slay.
But that is for another time.
For now he would keep it sublime.
When once the Knight left on his own,
Left once to conquer all alone,
A barbarian town he found
And walking up, he looked around.
The people passed, oblivious.
Lifted the Crown, to show them this.

Though in fact, he was not the King;
He was head of the Daemon-ring.
He rejoiced, for he was gifted.
Now he had his spirits lifted.
To him the Crown was being brought,
The best of treasures ever wrought.

And when she came, he let her stay;
She was a beauty anyway,
And to the dark side she could sway,
Although not so far as he may.
Gave her a bed in his own wing,
Bade her stay 'til she was nineteen.
She agreed, to be near the Crown,
Visited him in see-through gown.
Came to his chambers late at night.
But he replied, "Time is not right."
"Just wait 'til later in your life."
Was growling low, drawing her knife,
Her teeth were bared, she was prepared.
He looked at her, neither was scared.
He laughed, amused at how she fared.
He slept with her, no longer cared.

One Morning's candle had been lit,
The daemon had gone through a fit.
She was twenty, and had the Crown,
And she was no where to be found.
He'd found in her equal evil,
Now he could not even sit still.
For she was gone, and on her own,
After exacting a large loan.
The Crown of Kings she had with her.
Now in his foot, she was a burr.
Trident and Gem, all that he had,
For his stolen, yes, he was mad.
Though she was the best he e'er had...
Came in at night, all scantly clad.
But no, she would come back to him,
It was as if she were a nymph.

Forever gone, and never there,
Tried to find her, but knew not where.
To the divination he went,
Over to sphere that had been lent.
To his eyen images were sent,
And he had seen her will was bent.
In a ditch, her body was found,
She was living, but on the ground.
He traveled there, fast as he could,
She had the Kings' Crown, as she would.
She just fell down, as if she tripped;
In those shoes, she must have just slipped.
Fell down and wept, until she slept,
But paid great care to what she kept.
For that it was her only love,
And just for that, her life was rough.

But the daemon now kept her home.
So she would never again roam.
He loved her so, she did not know,
She only liked one thing he owned.
The Crown was her ultimate lust,
And for that, she, he would not trust.
He finally got her to pair,
A team like them was really rare.
But when they both formed a union,
They both felt the power of one.
Greater than he, with all things clad,
Power so good, they both went mad.
Held in the staff of some stranger.
Was in the house of a ranger.
His location did not matter.
Threw the Gem, broke with a clatter.

But the remnants of the green Gem
Clouded and gathered around them.
Filled them both with its own wisdom.
They are the strongest yet to come.
He the Trident, and she the Crown,
No mortal could they not put down.
But still there was the traveler,
His presence wasn't to occur.
The man, he bore a crooked staff,
And Eclipse saw and gave a laugh.
The power seemed inside the stick
But to kill him, it was a trick.
And so they came up unto him.
They remembered of the green Gem,
Of the knowledge which it gave them.
And they had each faced stronger men...

But of this, they both were all wrong.
When they heard the bell give a gong,
The man attacked them both with grace.
Before each died, peered at his face.
His was the face of the one God.
Killed them both with enchanted rod.
Once again, the Trident was set,
And now again, it was sunset.
The man, He brought the Crown with him,
The evil thing, its feeling grim,
He buried it up in a cloud,
Somewhere where it would not be found.
And the spirits of those he fell
Were set so that they could now tell
The story of their awesome greed,
For that's one thing that we don't need.

And of the daemon's blood was born
A son without parental scorn.
So like a goat he was in fact,
With Him some people drew a pact.
Was the most evil of them all,
He sprung after his father's fall.
He lifted up the Trident high,
And he called thunder from the sky.
His dad left him a legacy,
He knew just how the Earth should be;
Fountains of fire, blazing high,
His time of rule was coming nigh.
For so like His father He was,
And He knew just what must be His.

Another Jewel was in a pool.

He had two of three items now,
To get the third, He knew not how.
He only knew that to obtain,
Visit the lake on night of rain.
A storm He would have to invoke,
Then listen as the monster spoke.
Three tests of evil must He take.
Accepting, He'll hear the Earth quake.
His name was Hale, the daemon born.
He went through birth, they blew the horn.
He was who prophecies speak of.
His skin was horned, and scaly tough,
But besides that, He looked normal.
All that He need was at the pool.
To get the Jewel, He needed just
To get over His evil lust.

His first quest was to fetch a ring,
From the hand of a long dead King
Whose burial site was empty,
None knew where his body might be.
But He through divination found
Where the King was under the ground.
With ring in hand, He traveled back,
Now in turn, He need fetch a sack.
No normal thing was this old bag,
Was woven by a magus hag,
He went and just took it from her.
Able to take what He'd prefer,
The heart of whomever He'd want,
To never have to go and hunt.
To prevent its power to stay,
Went to the lake, gave it away.

His third quest was easily done,
Fought ninety battles, and had won.
Of course each fight was with His hands,
He's now renowned, best in the lands.
Now He had completed quest three,
Went to the lake, said, "Let me see
Just what it is that I'm to do
Is it to clean this putrid zoo?"
The monster in the lake just said,
"I'll give no answers to your head,
But yet I must unto thee give
Something that will let you just live.
The Gem I hold's metallic sheen
Was once supposed to appear green,
But as I hand it unto you,
The murky color's turning blue."

page20~
"The brightest blue I've ever seen,
Loyalty, it is held to mean.
I once had doubts about this thing,
But now I see what you must bring."
And so he handed it to Hale,
To do a deed which must not fail.
To bring to the world a new day,
To stop all this useless melee.
Hale started from the lowest pole,
To do His deed, He knew His role.
Although He's held to be evil,
He won't pursue a useless kill.
And so He rose, from his sessions,
Giving advice, teaching lessons.
Becoming the most trustworthy.
Now the most honest that there be.
read page21

page21~
And so He rose into a state
Where He and one-God had their rate.
But the one God, really jealous,
Of Hale's knowledge, was envious.
And so to battle, They then went,
With weapons that were never lent.
Enchanted staff against Trident,
They parried blows 'til staff had bent.
And so Hale threw him down to Earth,
And, too, everything of some worth.
He remade Heaven in His form,
He gave everything's present norm.
It is He who's now called one-God.
He even kept the magic rod.
But now, He won't participate,
Remains inactive as of late.
read page22

E
page22~
And now there is nothing He'll do,
He won't even prove that He's true.
For; without doubt; too hard we'd lean
Onto the Lord's protecting screen.
With no presence, we need have hope
To go through that with which we cope.
We cannot totally rely
On that being that's up on high.
Now Hale holds to neutrality,
And that is why we cannot see
What He wants each of us to do.
We each must look on our own view.
We aren't alone, but then we are,
It is a test to see how far
Each of us can go on our own,
As if we each were all alone.
read page23
~
E
page23~
But that is where others come in,
Our friends, yes, also kith and kin.
Onto each other can we lean,
To help us out with where we'd been.
And also onto the future.
We each hold in us the World's cure.
So as Hale sleeps, we leave him be,
Trident is set, so shall it be.
(Jim Harkanson)

overmantle mantle crimson embossed golden flames~
   This beautifully stitched overmantle is a deep red crimson color, and is
borne only by mages of the highest rank in the Conclave.  Its golden threads
almost seem to emit a low hum, as though they vibrated with the aura of mana.
In direct light the flames seem to dance about of their own accord.
