rod midnight black crimson~
   This rod is midnight black and has a round crimson handle.  The handle is
almost spherical in shape and has small pockmarks, looking quite like the red
moon.  The end has hollow sections and cylinder shapes sticking out of the end
of it.  It looks as if it would fit will in a special kind of slot, though
finding such a slot in a peculiar shape as that would be hard.
