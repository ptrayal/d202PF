Last Journal entry-day 19 of the months of woe, year 240
I fear this will be my last journal entry.  I entered this cabin 
late last night, the jagged arms of the trees nearby raking my body
as if I were nothing but a rag doll.  My body is shattered, the 
plague runs deep within me.  Whatever cursed soul dwells in this
bog will remain.  I just fear I will never have to meet such a 
powerful entity.  I fear it is as if we were playing a game of
the gods all along, and now I have failed.  My dear love lost,
I am left suffering at chemosh's gates, in my last moments 
pondering the choices I made, the paths I took, and searching
desperately to repent for my wrongdoings... but now, I see a 
vision before me, he is calling me to him, he is mumbling 
something..his visage is horrid, I feel that it has been he
all along that has infested me....his mouth opens..he 
says in a low voice to me..The choice...is yours...a second
chance...for your so....

Journal entry 3-Day 17 of the months of woe, year 240
My head continues to burn, as the heat in this swamp is unparalleled.  
It is now just myself, our guide, and Dariana, a member of the holy order 
of stars, that persists.  We have been searching all throughout this swamp,
looking for the Seren Temple, its whereabouts have been cloudy for near
five centuries, and now we have come so close, yet seem even further away.
The two of us, once being lovers, seem to be forming distances between
one another as well.  I look into my dear loves once beautiful elven maiden, and
see a fear, the likes of which I have never seen in her eyes. 
I know she feels even more strongly the evil that dwells here, and 
the forboding doom that lingers in ther air.  Whatever rules here
is by far a more supreme entity than any we have yet to encounter,
his mere trolls were much more than we ourselves could handle.  
I think she sees in the future our doom, one that she knows we should
avoid, but in the name of Mishakal, Kiri-Jolith, and Paladine, we
continue.  Knowing at any moment it could be our last.
Journal entry 4-day 5 of the months of repent, year 204
Today, unpredictible events have occured.  The burning in 
my head continued to swell, to a point where I near collapsed.
With every step we took through the sludge, so much so that
I let my guard down.  We approached the remains of what we
believe to be the location, and as we did so I blanked out.
When I came too, my love and our guide were gone, deep in
my heart I feel foul play was at hand.  A rather large lump 
located on my head, and many of my dear elven maidens belongings
thrown haphazardly round the room.  What beauty I once had,
now gone.  I once held her in my arms, the sweet scent of the
lilyvine orchid clinging to her form, as we embrace, I took
it in so greedily.  Now I lie, the plague strong in my body
and soul, I run, seeking refuge whereever I might, my quest,
love, and sense of living lost.

Journal entry 1-Day four of the months of woe, year 240
Today we set out for the first time into the depths of the swamp.  
We might be the first people to ever set foot here, as the stench
is unbearable, and breathing is so difficult that at times I
feel faint.  I can only pray that the light of Mishakal will
guide us through to see the end of this one.  Our guide leads
us on through the maze of trees and around the perilous 
skinkholes.  Without him, I don't think we would have lasted
even through the beginning of this cursed place.
Journal entry 2-Day 8 of the months of woe, year 240
Things have gotten incredibly worse, last night we ran into
the trolls, or moreso they ambushed us.  Standing near
three meters in height, and having claws the size of daggers
we sustained many an injury.  We had already made camp for 
the night, when the terrible beasts ran us through.  My
longtime companion, Herald the wise died as his last fireball
spell exploded in the face of his slayer.  We were then down
to only 3 of us and our guide, and began to flee, no time
for Herald's burial, when a troll of unheard of size
and strength blocked our path.  We fought of those from behind,
but the one in front was unwavering, Derim, the skilled
dwarven battlerager found himself no match for the towering
giant.  We rushed through the treeline, barely saving our 
lives as the trolls were following close at our heels.
I still know not why we managed to escape them, I just
know that I gave my thanks to the gods of good many times
tonight for the good fortune that came, and to protect
the souls of those that did not survive.  I myself
have begun to feel a deep pulsing from within my soul
and my forhead is hot day in, day out.  I feel there
is a stronger power at play in this marsh, but for 
our cause we must push on.

   This large podium is set facing the hundreds of fanatical individuals that
worship the dark lord.  Only Kezarian himself may address his cult members from
this location, and his two guards ensure that at all times he won't be
interrupted.  A large black velvet cloth hangs over the face of the podium, two
red glowing eyes staring out from the cloth.  They waver and move as a slight
steam rises out from within.

back~
A short story has been scribbled on the backside of this sheet
Ever do I wait, my victim unknowingly resting 
Deep down, he will soon be the carrier
Swiftly they will be overcome, no hope within their grasp
No remorse do I feel, only pride swells within
Seek for guidance I did, in return receiving enlightenment
Eternally following the vision I received, to the very end
Sever all ties I did, all sacrifices were made
No turning back, the young one will depart
Upon arrival, most will be infested
Never again shall they be known to their kin
Scan the underdark hard as you might, the Zakhar never to return to their brethren
I Kezarian Devar, singlehandedly responsible for such a masterpiece
