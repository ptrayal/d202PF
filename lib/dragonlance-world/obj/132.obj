guide leatherbound heavy~
   Many years ago archmages of the three orders in the Conclave of Magic began
construction of three gems of power.  These gems were labeled the "Chaos Gems"
and there were three gems created in total.  The first gem finished was the
"chaos gem of light" which was an absolutely flawless diamond, roughly the size
of a human fist.  The gem was placed in a platinum brazier in the High Tower of
Sorcery for safekeeping.  The second gem to be completed, and possibly the most
powerful of the three, was the "chaos gem of balance", a perfect ruby that
again, was roughly the size of a human fist.  This gem was placed beside the
"chaos gem of light" in the Tower of High Sorcery, in a bronze brazier.  The
third and final gem to be completed was the "chaos gem of darkness", a
beautiful octagon crafted piece of onyx.  This gem was slightly larger than the
other two gems, and was placed in a golden brazier in the same tower of
Sorcery.  In the passing years, Par-Salian has noticed that the chaos gems have
turned up missing, and he has been offering a reward for an undisclosed amount
to the finder of these chaos gems.
