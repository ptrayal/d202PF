bracers intricately woven arm length platinum~
   These bracers are unlike most bracers in that, while they run the entire
length of the arm from shoulder to wrist, the do not cover the entire arm upon
which they rest.  Instead they consist of dozens of weaving platinum bands
about half an inch thick, that run through and around each other in an
intricate pattern.  At the elbow the bracers are seperated by a light chain
mesh, also of platinum.  The design appears to be of elven make, and does not
look like it would inhibit arm movement in any way, aside from the slight
weight of the metal itself.

longbow bow polished mahogany~
   This bow is the hallmark of elven archery.  It has been created from a rusty
brown mahogony and has been given a fine glazed finish.  The wood is carved
with elvish calligraphy and symbols of the favored elven pantheon of deities.
The handgrip is bound with white leather and has been carved to perfectly fit
any grip.  The string appears to be of horsemane, though knowing the elves,
it's quite possible it may have come from a griffon as well.  All in all one
couldn't ask for a finer bow.
