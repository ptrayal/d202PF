wagon abandoned~
   This wagon is big enough for the driver to sit at the front, and carry only
two passengers.  Two of its wheels are missing, likely due to the narrow strip
of road.  However, the wood is in a state of decay that gives away the fact
that it has been here for some time now.

painting~
   This painting shows a small villiage covered in the fog of early morning,
the rooftops blocking out sections of sky.  Where the sky is visible, the sun
is just peeking over, a bold red-orange, which may look to those that look for
it, as though the sun is a fire about to settle on the small town.
