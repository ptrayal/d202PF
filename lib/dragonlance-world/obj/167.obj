bands~
  These strange items make a beautiful, if not bizzare pair.  They are simple
yet elegantly crafted bands, held together by fine silver meshing.  The bands
themselves are wrought from polished obsidian, yet strangely enough they are
rather flexable, not a trait of polished stone.  The bands are seperated by a
thin slit before completing a ring, with strong clasps present to hold them
fast if required.  Their enchanted flexability, and physical nature leads you
to believe you could strap these bands on either your arms or your legs.

ancient radiant bastard sword serpentine hilt life bane~
   This ancient bastard sword has been crafted from a cold-blue steel.  The
blade itself emits a brilliant radiance, though not of a magical sort.  The
strange serpentine handle has been crafted from flawless ivory and mithril, and
a soft vermilion cover has been placed around it for gripping purposes.  How
this elaborate astral blade came into existance is unknown.  At the base of the
hilt lies an eerie sigil of a faded yellow skull.
