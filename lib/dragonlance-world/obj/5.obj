wasn't very good looking, a flap of skin sewn over his left eye, and small
patches of hair scattered around his chin.  In his time, he had served as a
simple man aiming only for the magic.  He grew to take the office of Head of
the Black Robes.  However, he mysteriously died while traveling to the hall of
the elven cadre, to visit someone there.  Here, a statue has been erected to
preserve his memory.

you.  The man whom this statue represents, one Doreon Sandabar, was last seen
heading off for some treasure, but found much more than he expected.  Friends
had erected the statue so that even after he disappeared, he could continue to
listen to the waves, however, the beach did not hold the stone well, and so the
monument was moved to this grave site.

Dragons.  He was known both for his vile temper and his generous spirit.  
Known well and widely liked Thoran's presense is surely missed to all Solamnics
and indeed any who glorifies the name of what is good and righteous.

grave granite thick dirk~
   The tormented soul once known as Dirk "rests" here.  Though his body was
since lost by the Solamnics who found him poisoned by his own envenomed dagger,
we are all doubtlessly benefited by the passing of this evil creature.  Many
consider him one of the most dangerous mortals to walk Ansalon since the
Cataclysm.  His victims were many and his failiures few.  He was a man of many
faces, sometimes utterly volatile, sometimes friendly and benefitting, yet
always he carried an air of confidence and fearlessness.  Nevertheless, the
streets of Palanthas are much safer due to the mysterious passing of "Smoke".

be realized and we can only hope his successors can triumph where this truly
noble man has failed.  Paladine bless you Caide Delancis.

   Lisham was an ambitious man, thrust out from amongst his Silvanesti brethren
for being caught practicing black robed magic as a red robed mage.  He went
black shortly afterwords.  He was strong, yet slender and very intelligent.  
Residing in solace he spent most of his time with a large minotaur named Rufus,
and a sharply dressed man named Rush.  He was very involved in conclave
politics, and often battled with some mages who faught his rise.  His sudden
dissapearance after a visit to the Tower of Wayreth has always been in
question.
