parchment~
Sir Calhoun,
It is quite a pleasant surprise that you have once again decided to visit my 
humble market.  I will be expecting you at dusk, where a small feast will await
you at my house in your honor.  Though the slave trading is always at a low
this time of year, I have set aside two very fine brutes that you should
contentedly approve of.
Eagerly awaiting your presence,
-Alabastor Grismold
PS - There have been some outlandish rumors of an alligator inhabiting the
small pond to the north of my market, along the path leading in.  So far,
none of my men have seen any sight of one, so it is most likely nothing to
worry about.
