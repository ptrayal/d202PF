inscription hilt~
   This long slender longsword was crafted inlikeness to a large dagger.  The
blade itself is made for slashing, and the tip is strong enough to pierce even
the toughest armor.  Forged in the smithery of the Silvenesti Elves and imbued
with a special magic the blade should serve its wielder well.
