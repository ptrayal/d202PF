   Perhaps the keys to the tomb were distributed among the Irdan race before
the change had taken place.  In any case, the disk is now ours, and the
mythical tombs are ready to be explored.  I now deliver this disk and this
document to the Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth.  However, I first must meet
with my fellow mage, Dertun, in Thelgaard, to get his copy of the research
performed on the Irda Runes.  Then we must combine a force of mages to recover
the mummified irdan relic stolen by the draconians of Xak Tsaroth.  With these
items we should be ready to infiltrate the obelisk and explore the tombs
within.  In closing , I would like to state once again that if this document is
removed from the possession of the conclave of wizards, that action will be
taken to recover it.

tome~
   This document is by no means complete, and is only a record of legends and
myths, as well as our own research.  It is the property of the conclave of
wizards.  Any who should come across this document should return it at once.  
If it is not returned it will be located and taken from you, by force if
necessary.
  The onyx obelisk in the northern part of the plains of dust is more
than just a great monolith of precious stone.  It serves as the gateway to an
ancient Irdan tomb.  By our estimation, the obelisk and the maze of tombs
beneath it have been there since the age of light, and possibly before.  The
Irda were extremely adept at magic, even moreso than our own conclave.  This
fact, and the privacy that the race held so dear lead us to believe that the
tombs are filled with magical traps.  We have repeatedly tried to breach the
exterior of the obelisk, but to no avail, until recently.  The exterior of the
obelisk is covered in huge runes.  At the peak of the monolith, the runes are
deeply engraved.  By pure luck we have uncovered what we believe to be a key to
the great obelisk.  It is the plan of the conclave to explore these tombs and
research the great magic that the Irda race had mastered so completely.  The
key is a pierced disk, a circular stone with a hole in the middle.  It was
found among an ogre tribe in Blode.  If the myths are correct, the Ogres were
once Irda, that had been corrupted by evil and so changed into the grotesque
monster they now are.

untitled~
   The meaning of this rune is unknown both by the Ogres and by historians and
scholars alike.  No attempt to translate it has been made in the Krystann
Verse.  Comparing it to present day runes, it might mean "spring" or first
growth due to it's resemblance to the present day rune for "harvest".  
However, this is no more than a guess.

future~
   Some of the confusion with the rune of gift comes from this rune, which
stands for "diety", "language", "blessing" and "growth".  It's symbol is the
Lurel Tree, found only in the high reaches of the Khalkist mountains.  The
Ogres believe that if one eats the blue buds of the tree on the first day of
spring, they are protected from bewitchment.

gift~
   This rune stands for "horse" or "cart", signifying "status" and "wealth".  
It is also universally accepted by the Ogres to mean a gift either given or
received.  There also seems to be some connections with the gods, as in "gift
of a message".

destruction~
   Ice is the symbollic representation of this rune.  Similar to the rune for
danger, represented by hail, it represents tha destructive force that nature
can inflict, and also carries a second meaning of "grievances".  This rune is
also used on Ogre weapons, like the runes for "battle" and "death".

   This rune is similar to the stylized broken merchants scale of Hiddukel, god
of greed and ill-gotten gain.  The Ogres of Bloten refer to it as "noik" and
frequently scratch it onto table tops, a door frame, or on the ground before
agreeing to a business deal, believing it will bring them luck.

cattle~
   This rune is a sister rune to inheritance, and is rspresented as the horns
of an aurox.  It demonstrates "wealth", "strength" and "prosperity".  The Ogres
even suggest that it means "food" or "human", although that definition has not
yet been explored by scholars.

E
inheritance~
   The meaning of this rune is also suggested to be "gift" or "value", and it
is suggested by its resemblance to the common-day rune for "growth".  Another
meaning, "home", is suggested because of the rune's likeliness to mountain
peaks.  This is relevant because the Ogres often makes their homes in the lofty
peaks of hills and mountains.

death~
   This rune is represented by the inverted axe of Morgion, the god of disease
and decay.  This symbol, along with the universally acceptance among the ogre
population fortifies it's meaning.  It is often carved onto weapons, supposedly
to symbolize the great desire for the death of the enemy.

life~
   The shape of this rune resembles the rays of the sun streaking downward.  
It suggests meanings of "strength", "speed" and "health".  Annother suggested
meaning is "achievement", although this one is widely disputed by scholars and
historians.  The main argument for this rune is it's frequent use in reverse in
conjunction with the rune of death.

This rune has been found engraved on the blades of ogrish swords and daggers.

book scaled-hide scaled blue~
   Within these pages are the lost runes of the ancient and great Ogre
civilisation.  These ogres are known to us as the Irda.  Legend has it, the
Irda were the first of the humanoid races to dwell on Krynn, and were created
by the Dark Queen, Takhisis.  They were of the utmost beauty and intelligence.
Their cities rivalled even the elves in elegance, and rivalled the dwarves in
structure.  The Irda were not an evil race as a whole.  At some point in time
the evil ogres split from the rest of the Irda and became what we now know as
ogres.  Ugly, dimwitted and brutish.  The rest of the Irda have since been lost
and are rumored to be extinct.    
The runes found within are the lost language of this magnificent race.
They are rougly translated, and no meanings are meant to be taken completely
literal. However, they are relevant, and are the closest estimation that
will be found anywhere else on Krynn.
Among these runes are the following:
(Type READ <RUNE NAME> to investigate a specific rune)
OGRE, WATCHER, SEEKER, THIEVERY, TREACHERY, DOOM, ATTACK, BETRAYAL, DANGER,
WATER, BATTLE, AUGURY, LIFE, DEATH, INHERITANCE, CATTLE, GREED, DESTRUCTION,
GIFT, FUTURE, UNTITLED.

E
ogre~
   This rune represents the words "ogre" and/or "being".  It can be used for
either definition.  Our sources reveal that it is likely that this rune also
signifies a being of protection.  Present ogres still use this rune widely, and
refer to it as "ogro"

E
watcher~
   This symbol has been said to be derived from a star, a reference to the
beginnings of the universe and the races as they were in the heavens, before
being created by the gods.  The stars are sometimes referred to as "the
watchers of darkness".  This rune probably means "beginning", "birth" or
"dawn".

seeker~
   This rune has been given several meanings, among them "travel", "need", and
"fate".  As discovered from the Ogres of Bloten, it also sends off a feeling of
despair, seeking relief from it, and therefore hope.

thievery~
   The essense of "acquisition", "motivation" and "growth" are part of the
meaning of this rune.  It's similarity to the common-day rune of "possession"
leads us to believe that it also includes the dubious acquisitions made by
stealing as well.

treachery~
   This rune resembles the stylized condor that the acolytes of Sargonnas
prefer.  The resemblance hints that this rune carries the meanings "vengeance",
betrayal, "prefidy" and perhaps even "treason".

E
doom~
   There is no immediate and clear meaning of this rune, however it seems to be
associated with "bad health", unpleasantness" and "pain".  The Ogres of Bloten
have hinted that it means "fever", a meaning that is fortified by the rune's
similarity to the reverse of the present-day rune for wholeness and wellness.

betrayal~
   Both humans and ogres refer to this rune as the "Ogre rune".  It implies
conflict, "complexity" and "aggression".  The exact meaning has been argued
extensively by scholars, although some agreement has been made that the meaning
is certainly unpleasant.  It has the ability to change other runes when used in
specific sequences.

mace footman's crystal dawn treader~
   This magnificant weapon is quite ancient, although it's power is still very
obvious by the soft golden glow that emenates from it.  The mace is very long,
requiring two strong arms to wield it, and is made of a green-hued crystal.  
The head is heavily studded and seems to glow a little brighter than the rest
of the weapon.

bracer writhing snakes~
   This strange bracer is actually a twisting, writhing mass of serpents.  The
snakes hiss and snap as they squirm around each other, making you very wary of
actually putting them around your forearm.  However, as your hand nears the
spitting jaws, they move apart to allow your hand to pass through them.
