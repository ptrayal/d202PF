black~
   This statue is quite detailed, and upon looking closely one notices that
there are actually several figures etched into it.  Each being unique in it's
appearance.  The first is a simple black robed man, his face being conceiled
beneath his cloak.  In his hands rests a spherical object, several circular
indents running along its surface.  The second is a skull faced individual,
around him swarms small skeletons, all of which are evenly spaced.  The middle
is a large black clad warrior, it's features being quite female despite the
armor, upon which is etched a large five headed dragon.  The next figure is a
man with a deap cloak pulled around him, his face not looking all so well.  
The following figure is a large brutish minotaur, in his hands is a
double-bitted axe and an unmistakable grin of revenge covers his face, his form
towers over that of the accompaning figures.  Following the beast, is a single,
rather portly figure, his smile gleaming greedily, and a large pile of treasure
has accumulated at his side.

scale~
   On each side of the balance, several items are placed.  On the right lies a
pile of diamonds, several pearls, and a single marbled statue with several
figures.  On the opposing side several onxy gems of varying sizes are placed.
As is a jade necklace, and a contrasting statue that is quite similar to
thewhite.  The scale itself is molded out of a melted silver, and a single ruby
is faceted atop the balance.  The scale itself was made to resemble a rather
delighted man in his middle ages, wearing a robust outfit, as well as looking
quite well off.  In each hand he holds the diases, and as his arms are never
fully parallel to the ground, it appears as though he is spilling little bits
of his collection off each side as he goes.  Odd enough, nothing is ever
leaving his hoard as it sways.

grin.  No matter what is being evaluated here, this man always comes out ahead.
Each of these figures is carved out of a clear crystal, inside which a black
fluid flows in perpetual motion.

armguard~
   This armguard is formed entirely of polished bone, and was soaked for a
short time in a black pigment which has now found its way into all the crevaces
along the piece.  The symbol of a skull is now visible on the face of the
armguard, and the ink here was not nearly as heavily applied so it has a
yellowish pigment to it.  It is rumored that many centuries ago Chemosh himself
once wore this item, before he attained the position he holds in recent times.
