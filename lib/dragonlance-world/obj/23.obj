chapter1~
The Beginning:
Many thousands of years ago, there lived a large clan of wood elves, in the
secluded reaches of an unknown forest.  The ground had not been tainted by the
endless trade caravans, nor the loggers, which made their living by destroying
what all wood elves hold dear.  This sacred land had never been seen by any
eyes other than the elves and the Fey that also lived in the depths of the
forest.  Perhaps if a man sailed across massive oceans of blue, over endless
wasteland deserts, through the thick marshes, and into the massive forests of
which these elves lived, and by some chance did not go completely mad from the
endless journey, and by an amazing, God-like miracle managed to find the homes
of these elves, they would welcome him, as men are not entirely bad.
It was a golden age for the denizens of the wood.  Huge feasts were held every night.
Glorious choirs sang beautiful hymns, and musicians played songs that weaved
magic through the leaves.  Artisans and craftsmen created wondrous works of
art, sculptures that towered through the trees, and beautiful wreathes from the
Tree of Life that granted untold powers lost in legends to the city in the
trees.  There were no smiths, as they elves of this wood had no need for
weapons.  Words such as sword, and armor did not exist.  However, the elves
were masters of archery, although the thought of using a bow as a weapon had
never occurred to even the most adolescent of elves.  There was much rejoicing,
and life continued this way for thousands of years.
