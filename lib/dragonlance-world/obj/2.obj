blade~
  This strange, obviously magical weapon is formed completely of a flickering
golden flame.  It is shaped very much like a scimitar, yet you boggle at the
intention as, while the golden flames do not burn, they are still not solid
enough to wield... perhaps depending on who the wielder is.

berries~
  You carry here a handful of sweet-looking wild berries of assorted natures.
Some you recognise as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries,
cranberries and massaberries.  There are a few others that look just as
tantalizing, yet of a sort you haven't yet seen in your travels.

skull~
   This chain seems to create some sort of dread aura.  A silver skull pushes
forth from a jet black crescent, which in turn hangs from a long chain of
blackened steel.  An unholy crimson glow streams outward from the eyeless
sockets of the skull.  Clearly this is an unholy relic of some kind.

rather flexable, not a trait of polished stone.  The bands are seperated by a
thin slit before completing a ring, with strong clasps present to hold them
fast if required.  Their enchanted flexability, and physical nature leads you
to believe you could strap these bands on either your arms or your legs.

2cultists~
  If Morgion accepts, the ritual is started.  The ritual is performed by concocting
a potion of the blood of several differint plague and disease victims.  The
potion is completed by Morgion adding a single drop of his own blood.  The
liquid is then consumed by the cultist.
  I am the only man to this date to have taken this ritual and explained it's
effects, so they may differ for each man, however, I will explain what happened
to me.  Although I cannot see how it is possible, unless the effects are differint
for each man, or some sort of delisuion.  All others that I have witnissed taking
this ritual died within seconds or imbibing the potion.
  When I took the potion, was imediately consumed with an incredible burning
sensation, as if both the outside and inside of my body was on fire.  On top
of this, it seemed as if my mind was on fire as well.  I cannot explain the
feeling at all, save as I have.  It was the most extreme, chaotic pain I have
ever felt in my life.  However, this did not go on for simple seconds, or even
minutes... not even hours or days.  This pain seemed to go on for years... there
was no end to it.  There was no escaping it.  However, the pain finally stopped,
and when it did, I opened my eyes... they had returned from when they had once
been burned away by the danai worms acid.  The scars on my body were gone.
My health had been restored to that of a man in his prime once again, even
though I write this at the age of 57 winters.
  The prices to pay in Morgions cult are extreme, and unequaled.  However,
the rewards for those string enough to receive them, are boundless.  I am living
proof.

E
cultists~
  The cultists of Morgion are a seperate lot from the normal priesthood.
While the normal priesthood of morgion is bent on the same purposes as we,
the spreading of plague and desease, the creation of famine and pestilence,
and general strife and doom, we prefer differint methods.
  The priesthood, of course, only accepts those of a clerical background.  They
prefer to draw their power directly from Morgion himself.  The cultists accept
those from a multitude of backgrounds.  While we do draw some of our power
from Morgion, we also draw the same power from within ourself, from the land
around us, and from vile creatures from other planes.
  In order for a cultist rise in power, he must perform several rituals.  The
first is the donning of the black bark scale mail.  The armor is to be worn
at all times.  The suits used for rituals are fitted with the bark both on the
inside and outside.  For one full year the cultist must endure the scratching,
bleeding, festering wounds that ultimately will bring on infection, and are
caused from wearing the armor.  The next ritual has several parts. The cultist
point of death, where, if Morgion is impressed, will allow him to live with
the disease.  If not the cultist will die and become Morgions tortured slave.
The third ritual is placing danai worms on the cultists eyes.  The cultist is
bound hand and foot, and his head is locked firmly into place.  He is then
left with the worms for one month, kept alive by a sustenence spell.  The worms
secrete a slow acting, but powerful acid that melts the cultists eyes at a
terribly slow and incredibly painful rate.  With these rituals done a cultist
is complete.  The only ritual left after that is that of the high priest.
A cultist may choose to request for high priesthood from Morgion.

minions~
  Although the minions The Hooded One controls in his own world are plentiful
and extremely powerful, he is limited to the power of his priests and cultists
to allow those minions to cross over to our world.
  My own power has allowed two of his minions to manifest on Krynn, the plague
wraith and the shade of pestilence.
  Both are similar to the servants of chemosh in that they are the undead
servants that have been cursed (or blessed) by chemosh himself.  The same is
true for the plague wraiths and shades of pestilence, save that all who die
from plague and disease are under Morgions rule, not that of Chemosh.  If
a being is cursed by Morgion upon death by plague, the soul is held and changed
into a plague wraith.  Their absolute hatred for the living makes them difficult
to control, but their ability is extremely impressive.  Those who have served
Morgion well and die by pestilence are turned into shades of pestilence.  These
creatures are solemn, stern and impressively patient.  They strike intelligently
and with Morgions wrath.  They make excellent assassin and guardians.
  Both the plague wraith and the shade of pestilence have abilties similar
to their undead cousins, however, they also have the blessings of disease
offered by Morgion.  The plague wraith has no control over this power.  It
spreads disease to all it comes near.  The shade of pestilence can use it's
abilities choosingly, thus making assassinations much more efficient.
  I will continue my cummunion with Morgion and attempt to unleash more
of his minions into this world.

   The writing in this section of the tome is extremely blurred and completely
illegible.  The effect is similar to trying to read through a glass of water.
It is reminiscent of a magical effect reserving the writing for certain eyes

Four jagged horns protrude from the brow of the helm, and two more from beneath

"face" filled with several rows of razor sharp teeth and a long, but thin,
forked tongue darts in and out of the helm before your very eyes.

  This map clearly shows the forest surrounding the Fireside Tavern.
The central area is colored in green with small icons of trees within it.
Running through the center of the forest is the NewSea Road heading north and
south.  At the southern end of the road, on the eastern edge is the icon of
a house.  The forest is surrounded by high cliffs to the east and west.  A large
"X" is placed on the southern edge of the western cliff.
Scrawled on the back of the map is some more writing.

back~
On the back of the map is the following writing:
The maze on the eastern edge of the forest:
Go north 6 times.  Go south three times.  Go east as far as possible.
The maze on the western edge of the forest.
Go north 8 times.  Go south 5 times.  Go west as far as possible.
If this fails, do the following combination until you reach the hillside.
5 north.  5 west.
Once you hit the hillside, move away from the hillside until you reach the
Newsea Road.
