**  Within this city we have the bravest of souls, the      **
**  shrewdest of merchants, and the finest of wenches.      **
**  It's no wonder the Queen's own army has decided to      **
**  camp here, when they have all of Krynn to call home.    **
**  Kindly notice the various shops around the square, as   **
**  well as the elf and human slave auctions south of the   **
**  square.  Those who seek training can visit the Temple   **
**  of Takhisis and pay your respects to the priests there. **
**  Travelers just starting out should visit the city       **
**  slums on the north side of town, and do all of us a     **
**  favour and reduce the surplus population.               **
**                                                          **
