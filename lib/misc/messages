* Note: all lines between records which start with '*' are comments and
* are ignored.  Comments can only be between records, not within them.
*
* This file is where the damage messages go for offensive spells, and
* skills such as kick and backstab.  Also, starting with Circle 3.0, these
* messages are used for failed spells, and weapon messages for misses and
* death blows.
*
* All records must start with 'M' in the first column (for 'Message').
* The next line must contain the damage number (defined in spells.h),
* then the messages (one per line):
*   Death Message (damager, damagee, onlookers)
*   Miss Message (damager, damagee, onlookers)
*   Hit message (damager, damagee, onlookers)
*   God message (damager, damagee, onlookers)
*
* All messages must be contained in one line.  They will be sent through
* act(), meaning that all standard act() codes apply, and each message will
* automatically be wrapped to 79 columns when they are printed.  '#' can
* be substituted for a message if none should be printed.  Note however
* that, unlike the socials file, all twelve lines must be present for each
* record, regardless of any '#' fields which may be contained in it.
