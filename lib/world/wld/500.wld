The High Road: just outside Luskan~
   &X This spot marks the northernmost reach of the High Road, perhaps the most
important trade route of the Northern Sword Coast.  From here, the road works
its way south, linking Luskan with Neverwinter and eventually Waterdeep.  
Directly north of here is the busy and sometimes wild port city of Luskan.  The
salty tang of sea air drifts in from that direction, as do the noises of a
bustling, active population.

The High Road: near Luskan~
   The High Road is well built, constructed of hard-packed gravel and lined with
wooden posts laid horizontally to mark each boundary.  The port city of Luskan
can be seen off in the distance to the north, the roof tops of its buildings and
the sails of the ships in its harbors poking up over the horizon.  One
particularly tall, multi-spired tower juts upwards in the middle of the city.  
The High Road continues north and south.

A Strange, Unused Room~
This room is very odd.  There seems to be no way in or out.

The High Road: crossing a large bridge~
   This great bridge is built from thick, well-sanded boards of lumber that have
been nailed together and bolstered with triangular support beams extending
downward on each side.  The bridge spans the River Mirar which flows in from the
east, emptying out into the ocean not far from here to the west.  The white
water roars mightily underneath as it surges past, causing the planks of the
bridge to vibrate slightly.

The High Road: between Luskan and Neverwinter~
   The trees have started to thin out this far north, replaced by a landscape of
low tundra and icy plains.  The air always has a deep chill regardless of season
and more often than not the land is coated by frost or a light dusting of snow.
The High Road moves steadily through the increasingly barren scenery.

The High Road: between Luskan and Neverwinter~
   The High Road moves through a sort of corridor here, boxed in by a narrow
mountain range to the west and the trees of the Neverwinter Wood to the east.  
These tall obstacles on each side block out the sun, casting deep shadows across
the road throughout most of the day.  The air is crisp and naturally scented
from the nearby pine trees.

The High Road: between Luskan and Neverwinter~
   The dark green, coniferous trees of the Neverwinter Wood form an impenetrable
mass just a few paces off the side of the road to the east.  A tall cliff rises
up on the other side.  It appears that rock slides happen frequently around
here.  The cliff itself does not look very stable and there are numerous small
boulders in the roadside ditch that seem to have fallen down from above.

The High Road: between Luskan and Neverwinter~
   Posts have been staked into the ground at regular intervals along this
stretch of road, with knotted ropes strung between them to serve as a sort of
crude fence.  Beyond this on the eastern side are numerous windfalls of timber
stacked together in rough heaps; evidence of the logging trade that occurs
regularly within the nearby Neverwinter Wood.
