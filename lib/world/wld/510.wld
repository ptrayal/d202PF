Evermoor Way~
Rocky plains blanketed by long blades of golden grass sprawl out in each
direction.  White-barked trees sparsely pepper the land before you, the sound of
their rustling leaves barely audible.  Subtle winds lazily weave their way
through the flora as clusters of rock and stone reach out from the earth
seemingly attempting to elbow their way into the landscape.  Small rocks and
tiny clusters of weeds litter the path beneath you while wagon tracks have been
embedded deep into the hardened earth, lending a sense of the trail's use.

A vast stretch of rocky grasslands stretch out from the north, while a dense row
of modest hills rest in the south.  Clusters of wildflower dot the hillcrests,

Rocky plains blanketed by long blades of golden grass sprawl out in each
direction.  White-barked trees sparsely pepper the land before you, the sound of
their rustling leaves barely audible.  Subtle winds lazily weave their way
through the flora as clusters of rock and stone reach out from the earth
seemingly attempting elbow their way into the landscape.  Small rocks and tiny
clusters of weeds litter the path beneath you while wagon tracks have been
embedded deep into the hardened earth, lending a sense of the trails use.

Soft whistles can be heard as intermittent gusts of wind make their way through
the golden grass of the northern and southern plains.  To the far south, the
beginnings of foothills can be seen just before the horizon claims their view.

tracks left behind by its past travelers.

Almost immediately, the golden landcape peels away to reveal a more lush,
vibrant scene.  The banks of the river winding north and south house the
majority of the land's greenery.  Sounds of water rushing over the rocky
riverbed fill the air as you approach the bridge that spans the river.  Though
old, the bridge is a well-kept structure of wood and stone.

Soft whistles can be heard as intermittent gusts of wind make their way through
the golden grass of the northern and southern plains.  To the far south, the
beginnings of foothills can be seen just before the horizon claims their view.
Years of travel have caused the trail to become barren save for the multitude of
tracks left behind by its past travelers.

The well-worn road continues, hugging the northern banks a steady river.  
Sudden winds playfully lick at the trail, kicking up soft plumes of dirt that
rapidly fall back to the earth.  The air is cool, crisp and has a distinctly
clean smell.  Natural debris carlessly float atop the rushing water before
disappearing or reappearing from beneath the current.

Rolling, rocky plains sprawl out to your north covered with a colorful mix of
grass and wildflowers.  The road continues next to a sizable river directly to
the south.  Various types of flora, lush with life, have made their home on
either side of the riverbanks.  The soothing sound of sparkling water making its
way over rocky river bed greedily drowns out any ambient sounds.

Evermoor Way~
The grasslands to the south yield abruptly to a dense wall of towering trees.  
The unnatural-looking forest-wall looms eerily in the distance as if to silently
caution those who would tresspass on its verdant land.  A large stretch of rocky
grasslands continues out from the road to the north.

Along this stretch of wagon-beaten road the air hangs heavy, and winds carry a
thick, strange odor from the north.  Coppery grasslands continue north of the
trail while a huge forest of enormous trees stands near to the south.  From the
dense, forboding wall of trees can be heard the faint shrieks and shrills of
wildlife.

Years of harsh weather have all but erased any evidence of its demise.  Along

Evermoor Way~
Along this stretch of wagon-beaten road the air hangs heavy, and winds carry a
thick, strange odor from the north.  Coppery grasslands continue north of the
trail while a huge forest of enormous trees stands near to the south.  From the
dense, forboding wall of trees can be heard the faint shrieks and shrills of
wildlife.

The road stretches to the north and south, distantly flanked by forests to the
east and west.  Though still eerie, the western trees are not as unsettling as
the great expanse of trees to the east.  The air is more humid here and gentle
winds usher in the scents of the forests while the rustle of leaves can be
heard.

Almost immediately, the golden landcape peels away to reveal a more lush,
vibrant scene.  The banks of the river winding north and south house the
majority of the land's greenery.  Sounds of water rushing over the rocky
riverbed fill the air as you approach the bridge that spans the river.  Though
old, the bridge is a well-kept structure of wood and stone.

Evermoor Way: near Everlund~
A majestic range of snow-capped mountains stand to the east, their peaks
spearing up through the wispy clouds that hang near their tops.  Directly west
flows a river of crystal blue water on a bed of hard, rocky earth.  The air is
cool and crisp with strong winds bearing down from the white-tipped giants.  
The trail snugly continues through the small bit of flatlands that run between
the western river and eastern foothills.

Evermoor Way~
A majestic range of snow-capped mountains stand to the east, their peaks
spearing up through the wispy clouds that hang near their tops.  Directly west
flows a river of crystal blue water on a bed of hard, rocky earth.  The air is
cool and crisp with strong winds bearing down from the white-tipped giants.  
The trail snugly continues through the small bit of flatlands that run between
the western river and eastern foothills.

Forced by the river's current, the trail curves east abruptly, hugging the
verdant banks tightly as it continues north and south.  The seemingly
ever-present eastern mountains continue to loom overhead, stealing the dawn's
first rays from this part of the land.  The air is cool and crisp with strong
winds bearing down from the white-tipped giants.

A great and foreboding range of mountains stands to the east, green with life
