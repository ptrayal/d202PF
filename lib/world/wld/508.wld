The Long Road: north of Waterdeep~
   The landscape northeast of Waterdeep consists mostly of grassy meadows with
some stretches of arable farmland.  Although not quite as busy as the High Road
to the west, the Long Road sees its fair share of traffic as people travel from
Waterdeep to important northern communities such as Mirabar and Silverymoon, and
back again.  The highway itself is wide and flat, with low fences on each side
to keep random animals off the road.  You can see the towers of Waterdeep rising
up off in the distance to the southwest.

The Long Road: north of Waterdeep~
   There are a lot of flowers on each side of the road, of many different colors
but most commonly yellow and purple.  The highway is made from crushed gravel
that has been graded into a relatively flat, smooth surface.  Now and then a
trade wagon or convoy of pack mules will pass by, but for the most part the
traffic along this stretch of road is lower than most other trade routes of the
north.  The highway continues north and southwest.

   A simple, rustic wooden fence constructed of rough, knobby logs lines each
side of the highway along this stretch.  Beyond the fences you see vast meadows
of green and yellow grass with groups of horses grazing or galloping around
playfully.  There are a few clusters of trees, mainly birch, with older animals
curled up together beneath them, resting and enjoying the shade.  The Long Road

   The Long Road bends here, skirting around the edge of a shallow pond to the
north.  The pool appears clear and refreshing, and from what you can see, seems
to be the only water source around for miles.  Horses, cows and sheep can always
be found gathered around the watering hole, taking a break from their busy day
of munching grass to get a cool drink.

   The Long Road bends here, skirting around the edge of a shallow pond to the
north.  The pool appears clear and refreshing, and from what you can see, seems
to be the only water source around for miles.  Horses, cows and sheep can always
be found gathered around the watering hole, taking a break from their busy day
of munching grass to get a cool drink.

The Long Road: between Waterdeep and Triboar~
   A simple, rustic wooden fence constructed of rough, knobby logs lines each
side of the highway along this stretch.  Beyond the fences you see vast meadows
of green and yellow grass with groups of horses grazing or galloping around
playfully.  There are a few clusters of trees, mainly birch, with older animals
curled up together beneath them, resting and enjoying the shade.  The Long Road
continues north and south.

   The surrounding land is pastoral and serene, consisting mostly of farmers'
fields with intermittent small orchards and wildflower patches.  Buildings are
few and far between, and are related primarily to agriculture: silos, barns and
the occasional rustic homestead.  The road is wide and flat, with no apparent
bumps or wheel ruts.  It continues northeast and southwest.

The Long Road: south of Triboar~
   The Long Road south of Triboar is wide and well groomed.  It travels through
golden fields of wheat, which ripple hypnotically with each passing gentle
breeze.  At times, fat, black crows can be seen fluttering about in the crops,
their loud, raspy caws occasionally breaking the pleasant silence.  Some parts
of the field have been roped off and divided into sections to mark each farmer's
territory.  There are a few piles of discarded chaff along each side of the
road.

A Large Intersection~
   Four roads converge here to form a large intersection.  To the north, a long
highway extends into an expanse of dry, dusty prairie.  Southward, a flat and
well-groomed route moves through a rural area of thriving farmland.  Looking
northeast, a far-reaching, snaking thoroughfare leads off through grasslands and
forest towards a large swamp off in the distance.  There is a smaller road
leading west, heading towards what looks to be a small town.

The Road to Triboar~
   This small road, nothing more than an oversized track really, heads through
vibrant wheat fields towards the town of Triboar.  The buzzing sound of cicadas
fills the air, while grasshoppers jump around through the crops and across the
road.  Men can be seen working in the fields surrounding the road, while the
jubilant sound of children at play can be heard faintly off to the west.
