The High Road: between Neverwinter and Waterdeep~
The High Road connects Neverwinter with Waterdeep, serving as one of northern
Faerun's most vital links.  Its importance is underscored by the excellent
condition of the road.  Despite the heavy traffic it receives daily, the highway
is almost perfectly level and clear of debris.  The well-groomed gravel surface
has virtually no potholes at all and contains only a few minor wheel ruts.

There is a roughshod wooden fence lining each side of the highway here,
presumably to keep wild animals off the road.  Horse-drawn carts and convoys of

stirred up as merchants' wagons drive past.  The high frequency of traffic along
the road means that regular guard patrols are necessary to keep preying bandits

The High Road: between Neverwinter and Waterdeep~
The surroundings here are rather plain; nothing more than empty grassland as far
as the eye can see.  The High Road crosses this countryside, serving as the main
trade route between Neverwinter and Waterdeep.  Little clouds of dust are
stirred up as merchants' wagons drive past.  The high frequency of traffic along
the road means that regular guard patrols are necessary to keep preying bandits
in check.

The High Road: between Neverwinter and Waterdeep~
This section of road moves through a landscape of empty pastures and dead
meadows.  There are a few shrub-like bushes and the occasional crooked tree
standing in the fields, but for the most part there is very little large
vegetation.  The High Road passes through here, a perfectly straight, grey blade
of gravel slashing through a canvas of yellow grassland.

Barren countryside stretches out as far as the eye can see.  The road is
well-traveled, and sliced in places by wheel ruts from passing wagons.  This is
the main overland trade route between Neverwinter and Waterdeep.  Hundreds of
people and thousands of pounds of goods pass through here every day.  There is
not much to see around these parts except for empty plains and the occasional
lonely coyote off in the distance.

The High Road: near the Mere of Dead Men~
The ground is wet and spongy on either side of the road, which has been built at
an elevated height to keep it from flooding.  Now and again, a layer of cold,
ankle-high mist blows in from the murky swampland to the south.  If you stand
and listen for long enough, you can hear an ominous growling sound drifting in
with the wind.  The High Road continues its way northwest and southeast.

The High Road: near the Mere of Dead Men~
The road passes near the Mere of Dead Men here, which is a flooded saltwater
swamp famous for its collection of yuan-ti and powerful undead monsters.  
Fortunately, very few of these creatures ever venture anywhere near the highway.
Nevertheless, it is wise to keep a vigilant lookout just in case one of them
happens to wander too far from its home.

vast expanse of the marshland, which is tucked away within a low-hanging cloud
of white mist.  Deep ditches have been dug parallel to the road on each side to
collect rainwater and swamp runoff.  There are noticeable areas in the road

The High Road: near the Mere of Dead Men~
The elevated highway is in good shape, but the ground off to either side is
soggy and wet.  Northeast of here, the High Road winds its way around the
infamous swampland known as the Mere of Dead Men.  To the south, the jagged
rocky peaks of the Sword Mountains rise up in the distance.

The High Road: near the Sword Mountains~
The road slopes abruptly upwards to the south as it enters the reaches of the
Sword Mountains.  This mountain range, famous for its large population of
aggressive orcs, acts as a sort of buffer zone between Neverwinter and
Waterdeep, making travel between the two great cities more difficult than it
would otherwise be.  Nevertheless, trading groups pass through the mountains
almost daily despite the elevated terrain, colder temperatures, and the
dangerous possibility of encountering hostile orcs.

The High Road: within the Sword Mountains~
Icy streaks of frost crisscross the crushed stone surface of the highway.  The
quietness of the mountains is striking; now and again there is a resounding
clack as a dislodged stone falls down onto the rocks from above, but for the
most part it is absolutely still and silent here.  The everpresent coldness
creeps into your body, burrowing deep into your bones.

The mountains appear to have been blasted apart by magic here, creating a gap
wide enough for the road to pass through.  There is little snow, but long
icicles hang down from the surrounding rock walls.  The road itself is a bit
rough, but still of quite high quality; certainly good enough to allow the
typical wagon train to pass through unhindered.

The High Road: within the Sword Mountains~
The mountains appear to have been blasted apart by magic here, creating a gap
wide enough for the road to pass through.  There is little snow, but long
icicles hang down from the surrounding rock walls.  The road itself is a bit
rough, but still of quite high quality; certainly good enough to allow the
typical wagon train to pass through unhindered.

The High Road: within the Sword Mountains~
Your boots crunch heavily on the frozen gravel of this section of the High Road,
which cuts through the great Sword Mountains.  Your breath turns immediately
into puffs of white fog as it exits your nose and mouth into the surrounding
cold air.  The sides of the highway are lined with tall, wooden poles, which
serve as a protective barrier from mountain rock slides.

A bone-chilling fog hangs heavy in the air and the surrounding stone of the
mountains is streaked with frost.  The road leads through the mist, which
obscures visibility to a dangerous degree.  It is easy to become nervous
traveling through the Sword Mountains, which are home to many bands of orcish
bandits.  But, because the High Road is the most direct route from Neverwinter
to Waterdeep, traders have no choice but to come this way.

steep slope.  A vertical cliff drops off on the side of the road, plunging down
into a deep gorge.  Luckily, mountain road crews keep the route well-maintained,
so there is little danger of falling if you keep away from the edge.  In

The High Road: within the Sword Mountains~
Traces of snow line each side of the road, a permanent effect of the high
altitude of the Sword Mountains.  The towering rocky peaks surrounding the High
Road are breathtaking, as is the bitterly cold air up here.  Occasionally, there
are broken spear shafts or ragged remnants of cloth off to the side; ominous
reminders that you are not alone within these mountains.

There is a slight chill in the air here.  All around, the rocky spires of the

unhindered.  Of course, there is always the ever-present threat of orc raiders,
who have been known to inhabit this area.  The High Road continues through the

   The rocky expanse of the Sword Mountains dominates the view to the north and
west.  The High Road slopes gently upwards, leading into the great mountain
range.  There are a few wheel ruts in the gravel, but overall this road is quite
well taken care of.  It continues northwest and southeast.

Just north of Waterdeep~
Directly south of here is Waterdeep, the City of Splendors; the Crown of the
North.  Waterdeep is considered to be the most important and influential city in
the north, and perhaps all of Faerun.  Its majesty dominates the southern
landscape; an eclectic sprawl of spires, shops and port areas.  It is said that
all roads lead to Waterdeep, but you can only see two of them here; one leading
northwest and the other northeast.

Outside Waterdeep's North Gate~
The northern gate of Waterdeep is almost always open, admitting travelers,
traders, tourists and thieves at all hours of the day or night.  As a place
tolerant of all races and religions, the citizenry is extremely diverse.  
People of all shapes and sizes come here to make their fortune.  You may join
them by walking through the gate to the south.

Overlooking the City of Neverwinter~
This city is surrounded by a stone wall to keep out unwanted visitors and
thieves.  The wall rises up 20 feet into the air, and completely encompasses the
city.  The city itself is nestled within the only pass found along the entire
length of the Fang mountains.  Banners flap in the wind, brandished with the
insignia of a clenched fist.  A small building lies nestled behind a gate to the
southeast.

Outside Neverwinter's South Gate~
You stand just outside the southern gate of Neverwinter, sometimes called the
"City of Skilled Hands" for its large population of artisans and accomplished
gardeners.  A popular tourist destination, the city takes its name from the
Neverwinter River, which flows with a warm current heated by fire elementals
that creates a permanent mild climate in the immediate area.  The city proper is
north, while the High Road is off to the southwest.
