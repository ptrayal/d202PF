The Helm of the "King's Treaty"~
   You stand at the helm of the spelljammer ship, "King's Treaty".  From here
the ship is able to be steered, entered and left.  The helm is within a
magically reinforced glass dome at the top of the ship.  The rug is actually a
tapestry depicting the royal family of Cormyr, the Obarskyrs.
