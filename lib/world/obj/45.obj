skull~
This human skull is covered in bits of charred flesh.  Flipping the skull around
in your hands, you find a large puncture through the bone around the back side
of the head.  It almost seems as if a mining pick was the cause of death, and
the fire was moreso to get rid of the remains.  The bandits of this campsite
must have had some reason behind this barbaric death.

book nocturn woods~
This book is encased in animal skin, and has been tanned and painted upon its
cover.  The title reads "Nocturn of the Woods", though no author's name is
present.  Thumbing through the book, it looks like it's a book of nightly
prayers, nearly all relating to nature in some way.
