Welcome to d20MUD!

Please note that the credits file must not be removed or altered, though you
may add on to it.

You must also include the standard DikuMUD and CircleMUD credits somewhere in
your login sequence.

Because of the Diku License, you may not collect money or donations for any
reason from the mud.  The mud web site is another story.

Please do not take credit for my work (Gicker), nor remove my name from the
credits.

Aside from that, go to town!

Enjoy the codebase!
