MOBILE STANDARDS: See @RMEDIT STANDARDS@n

   Never use outrageously large numbers. This will crash stock OLC. There are
limits on TBA to prevent crashes. But, it is just a waste of time to set large
numbers or applies that unbalance the game. You will be made to fix them if you 
want your zone used or approved.
   Zcheck (level 31+) checks a zone for these and other standards.

@@

The @@ character is used as a colorcode. If you see it, try toggling color to
complete. If this still does not work you must not be able to view colors.

Many people have asked why use the @@ as colorcodes while others use &. 
Welcor of TBA changed this because of trigedit. A builder who enters:
if %actor.is_pc% && %arg% would only see: if %actor.is_pc% & %arg%. No 
big deal, but this could get confusing to newbies when you tell them AND 
needs 2 & and they will only see &. The second problem is that trigedit 
also uses the special character & to denote mob/obj pronoun: IT, YOU, 
HE/SHE: &%obj%. So putting in colorcodes in echos returns garbage itititit
etc. if done improperly. The fix is to use the escape character \&<colorcode> 
in trigedit.

HIDDEN-DOORS . HIDDEN-EXITS HIDDEN-ROOMS HIDDEN-OBJECTS HIDDEN-MOBS SECRETS UNSEEN

   Hidden objects and mobs are not listed in the room descriptions but are still 
present and may be acted upon by players. 
   This is done by starting the l-desc with a period (.). Unless a player has 
holylight on they will not be able to see it. To make things easier please 
please include the keyword "hidden" on the object or mobile.

.This is a hidden object/mob. This long description can only be seen with holylight.
This normal description can be seen by anyone.

To make hidden exits or secret doors use trigedit.

DC

Usage: dc <descriptor number>

   DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket.  If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground. DC is also useful for 
disconnecting people who have accidentally left themselves at the main menu, 
or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.

SPECIALS SPEC-PROC SPECIAL-PROCEDURES SPECPROC SPEC_PROC

   Special procedures are used to allow certain complex functions to rooms,
mobs, and objects. They are written by coders and are normally not created
by builders. If you have something you wish to assign a special procedure to
talk it over with a coder. The most common special procedures include:
Postmasters, banks, guildmasters, pet shops, and boards. If your zone requires 
any of the above mudmail your coder after your zone is complete.
   Most of the things possible through special procedures can now be done
through trigedit. 

To create a postmaster make a mob, set one of the keywords as "postmaster," set
the NPC flag SPEC, and load it to the room via zedit. Then have your coder add
to spec_assign.c:110:  ASSIGNMOB(#, postmaster); NOTE: # = the mob/obj vnum.

To create a guildmaster make a mob, set one of the keywords as "guildmaster," 
set the NPC flag SPEC, and load it to the room via zedit. Then have your coder 
add to spec_assign.c:69:  ASSIGNMOB(#, guild); A player can practice at any
guildmaster, it is the guildguards that usually limit who can access what
guildmaster. @RTSTAT 133@n

To create a bank make an object, set it to type OTHER, add keyword "bank" and
load it to the room via zedit. Then have your coder add to spec_assign.c:
138:  ASSIGNOBJ(#, bank);

To create a board make an object, set it to type OTHER, add keyword "board" and
load it to the room via zedit. Then have your coder reference boards.c for the
remaining instructions.

To create a petshop see: @RHELP PETSHOP@n.

In all cases special procedures need to be added in by a coder. Once your zone
is complete mudmail your coder for the additions you want including type and
mob or object vnum.

WORK

   Most new builders underestimate how much work it takes to build a good zone.
Do not expect to finish everything to perfection in one week. Do not plan a 
500 room metropolis as your first zone. The typical new builder will start a 
grand project only to find themselves over their head with work after two
weeks with no end in sight. The result is almost always a sloppy, hastily 
finished product or a perpetually unfinished one. Either way the builder ends
up discouraged and their zone is unusable. To prevent this from happening all 
you have to do is PLAN. The more time you spend planning the easier time you 
will have building. There is nothing worse than making half a zone and then 
running out of ideas. You then have to start making more ideas up and they 
will not fit well into the zone.

#1
PLANNING

   There is a wide range of mistakes that builders can make when starting a new
zone. Zones that have had extensive planning before creation avoid most of 
these mistakes.
   Do you know the MUD? Most MUDs are meant for role-players. Do you know what 
the environment of the MUD is? Have you looked at the zones others have built?
I would suggest playing a mortal to at least level 10 before attempting to
build anything to get a feel for the realm. Most importantly, have you read the
background story? I was amazed at how few people read the background story.  
MUDs have themes, and it will always benefit you and the MUD to follow them.  
The best builders come to a MUD saying "I can build anything, what does the 
MUD need?"
   The first thing to do when sitting down to build a zone is just that - sit 
down and think about it. A zone should always start out on paper long before 
it reaches a MUD. Every zone starts with an idea or a spark. From there, 
develop it. Pay attention to what kind of zone theme you want to create. Is it
meant to be generic hack and slash experience zone? A wealthy populace to fill
the player's purse with gold? A quest for a special item? The possibilities are
limited only by your imagination. The important thing to remember is that zones
are built for players. Ask yourself, would you want to play in this zone?
   To help brainstorm I suggest you check out the many different zones 
available on TBA. All zones are required to have a zone description room in 
the first vnum of the zone. Goto 1900, 2700, 2900, 20000, 14500, or 15100 for 
some good examples. Feel free to look at any of the other zones listed under 
show zone. Beware, some may be unfinished and poor examples. 
   Assign VNUMs to your rooms/mobs/objects beforehand and write them down. Do 
not try and remember every VNUM you used mentally. Make lists of your mobs and 
objects. You can always add to the list later. After you have done all this 
you will already have a huge head start on your zone. Planning will pay off in
the long run.
   All in all, the best way to make an area interesting is to use variety,
intelligence, and imagination in building. Try to imagine what it would be
like for you to walk through and what you might try looking at or doing, and
then try to incorporate that into your area. Show your area to others and take
their advice. By taking all of this extra effort in creating your area, you
will be rewarded by leaving a lasting memory of your area in the minds of many
players. do not let your area fall by the unfinished wayside!  Work on it a
little every day, even if it is only one or two rooms worth of work. Likewise,
do not fill space by just making more of the same mob or duplicate room
descriptions. Take your time and do a thorough job, not one that is only 
superficially good.    
   It is recommended that you write out your descriptions on some kind of text
editor or word processor on your own computer before putting them on a MUD.
You can then cut and paste your descriptions in as needed. The advantage to 
this method is that if you accidentally wipe out your work on the MUD you will
have a ready backup. Be careful cutting and pasting to the MUD; if you send too
much text at once you will be disconnected.

CARTOGRAPHY

   The reasons behind mapping are simple. It solidifies what you are planning 
to build into MUD terms. Also, though final products rarely are an exact copy 
of the map, they provide a concrete reference for you to look at when the 
builder's block question rears its ugly head "Hmm, what do I build next?" 
Lastly, not all players have nifty clients especially made for MUDding with 
automappers, etc. We would not want those poor unfortunate souls to be at
more of a disadvantage than they have to be... and maps are highly important 
to knowing a MUD, even if you keep them all in your head as a few players do.
   A specific map is required so that the rooms can be linked together in a 
way that makes sense geographically. It is the most annoying thing to be 
playing a MUD whose rooms are not geographically correct. A very important 
aspect of each room is the position of other rooms in relation to it. Great 
care should be given to making the rooms link logically. A player who moves 
north, east, south, west should find themselves back in the same room from 
which they started. Having an area geometrically correct makes it much easier
for a player to visualize it, and thus increases their enjoyment of it.

#1
LOCATIONS

   It is very important to know where an area is going to fit in with the world
before it is written. This may seem very obvious, but it is a painful truth
that many people make areas without regard for where they will be placed on the
MUD. A character should not be walking around in an idyllic happy forest and
suddenly come upon an arctic wilderness.  Likewise a character should not
venture a couple steps outside a main human city and find themselves in an
ancient elven homeland. Plan where your new area is going to go and make sure 
it does not grievously conflict with surrounding terrain, climate, politics, 
mythology, and races. 
   The best thing to do, of course, is to integrate your zone seamlessly with
the rest of the world rather than allowing for one connecting point and sealing
the zone off from its surroundings in all other directions. It is not easy to
do this, and it is not always even possible. But it is worth spending some time
working on the rooms that link the zone as you first conceived it.
   If it is a city, the main gates probably are going to open out onto an
existing road, not into the middle of a forest.  Give some thought to using a
few rooms to link the "main" part of your area to a spot that is already in the
MUD (be creative - as well as roads and pathways, there are waterways and other
means to reach places). If it is more of a wilderness-type area, then the way
it links might be a bit more vague, and it might link in more than one place - 
when was the last time you saw a forest, field, or desert that could only be 
reached in one way? As important as where the zone should begin is where it 
should end. A city or even a village might have walls and a logical "edge," 
but if you are working with wilderness or even just the surroundings beyond 
the city itself, it is hard to know where and how to draw the boundaries.
Natural formations seem like the perfect answer -- rivers, mountains, and so
on -- BUT (and I think this is a huge but) the problem with these is that they
are extremely prominent geographical features and are not a good "throwaway"
solution.  
   If you are writing forest room upon forest room and think you will never get
to the end, do not just write in an insurmountable mountain range or a 
gratuitous river.  That will lead to questions like, "What is on the other 
side of the mountains, and why can not I approach them or even see them from
anywhere else?" or "Why did this river suddenly come to an abrupt end as soon 
as I left this forest?" Far better is to do something on a smaller scale -- the
trees just get too dense to move on... do not assume that your area has only 
one or two points of entry. Try and make your area accessible from at least 
two different points, preferably in different directions. Try and leave at 
least one possible exit on each "side" of your area in case something needs 
to be linked to it later. 
   TBA allows builders to create whatever their hearts desire and we have no 
MUDwide theme. Because of this your zone will be isolated from all others and 
should be designed to be added easily into any MUD. For location you should
plan the geographic environment: Forest, tundra, city, port, etc.

#1
THEMES

   The theme for an area is its reason to be.  A theme can be simple. Like, a
homeland of a few loose-knit families of storm giants. Or, a part of the sea
where a merchant ship from Anon is engaged in battle with a pirate ship. 
Themes can, and should be elaborate and include insight into the history of 
the zone, how its society and economy work, current plots or conflicts going 
on in the area, and how other people in the world view the place. The more 
work you put into the theme the better it will be, and the better other areas 
will be that build off of it. Discuss your ideas and concepts with others to 
help develop them to their fullest.
   Zones should be well fleshed out stories that catch the visitors attention 
and bring out their curiosity, making them want to stay for more. The 
descriptions should be well fleshed out, bringing images into the players 
minds, and there should be challenges and tricks that the player will not 
expect.
   Try and build a mini quest into part of your area so that characters can 
do something active rather than feel like aggressive tourists.  If you are 
building a wilderness area, perhaps include some kind of hidden/trapped 
treasure one can find. If you are building a populated area, think about 
having some mystery that a player can uncover. Built-in quests make a good 
area great.    
   Another way to make an area interesting is to create some sort of plot line
for it, or a coherent theme, rather than a collection of haphazardly related
rooms.  The plot can be complex like infiltrating a castle to garner the war
plans of the evil Lord Zygol, or simple like ridding the caves of goblins, or
anything in between.  Often the plot in an area can be advanced by some fairly
simple puzzles or descriptions.  This can be done with the help of triggers.
   TBA allows you to build anything you would like. Themes could include:
sci-fi, futuristic, medieval, present day, ancient history, Jurassic, western,
Chinese dynasty, etc. 

#1
ZONE-SIZES SIZES

   Make sure to have some idea of how many rooms total you will use. Make a 
definite decision. 20, 40, 80, 100. Try and shoot for a multiple of 20. We 
have no minimum amount that we set for a zone in terms of how many rooms. But, 
we do limit new builders to only 100 vnums for their first zone. Make a
quality zone and we do not care how many rooms it is. 
   If this is your first area, keep it small. Even under 50 rooms! You will 
soon see this is a fair amount of work and gives you quite a bit of room to 
accomplish what you have in mind. Once you have completed something of this 
size and are proud of your work, you can always add to it or make another
larger zone later. If this is not your first zone, decide how many rooms you 
will need and divide it up into 100 room zones. A cluster of small areas that 
get phased in gradually is much better than one gigantic area that is never
completed. Trust us when we tell you a 300-room area will never be finished 
without Herculean effort of which most of us are not capable.    

#1
ALIGNMENTS

   Many good areas stick to a defined level range, such as 10-20 or 25-30. Do 
not try and make your new area cover the entire range of levels.  Every area
should have its moment in the sun. Conversely, it would be nice if there were
something really unique and challenging to do at every stage in a characters
history. Your area might be the most successful if you can gear it for a range
of levels that people believe is otherwise boring or neglected.
   You should always try to match your mobiles to the area and the players you
want to play there. For example, you should make the mobs in the area a 
similar level to the players you want to play there since a level X warrior
should be able to kill a level X mobile if the warrior is at full health. Also,
the quality of objects or mobiles should be matched with their level.
   Will your area be mostly good, neutral, or evil.  If it is mostly good or
mostly evil, is it strongly good or evil or just weakly aligned?  In any case
try not to make your area completely homogenous (equal). In neutral
communities there is going to be some evil and good elements, and likewise with
other communities. To some extent this goes along with the question about zone
level, consider what seem to be "gaps" among the zones in the world as far as
good or evil aligned areas for a particular level range, and try to fill those
needs. Everyone's first tendency is to make extremists--The ultimate evil hell
area, or the blindingly good paladin fortress. Keep in mind that there are
many layers in between, and these are often more interesting.

#1
PLOTS

The plot of a zone is the main story of the zone. Such as: hack and slash, 
rescue the princess, find a precious stone, kill the dragon, or forging a 
special weapon.   Most builders do not take the possible ecology or economic 
effects of an area into account. By this, I do not mean having a mini-model of 
an actual ecological environment, but rather having things that make the area 
seem more plausible. The best things to put in to make an area more plausible 
are useless objects that actually add atmosphere to the area. Food sources for 
the mobiles in your area are always necessary to fleshing things out, as are
creating import and export goods for cities, complete with customs houses.
   Your zone should have a strong plot that is incorporated throughout. This
can be done by using the different descriptions available. Mobile look
descriptions and extra descriptions such as: trails, scrapings on the wall, 
etc. Trash objects can be created that are notes or maps.
   When designing your area and the plots within, you should always consider
what kind of player you want playing in your area. Keep the levels and types
in mind (i.e. role-playing, power-MUDder, etc). In doing so, try to have fun
building the area. Make it well rounded and something that you enjoy looking
through afterwards. If you find something you do not like, edit it and change
it until you like it. It is always best to build when you are not bored of the
area, since building when you are bored almost always turns out uninspired and
boring areas.
   If you are having problems developing a plot try visualizing a story that 
happens in your zone. For example, say a princess is captured somewhere 
and her relatives are looking for her. Next, you drop some clues to her 
whereabouts by putting conversations in the looked at description of mobiles. 
You can set up some mobs so that when you look at them, you get "You strike up
a conversation with the shopkeeper. He chats with you about the rise and fall 
of the price of wheat. Looking at the candy jar he sighs. You ask him why, and
he relates a sad tale of how he has not seen a little girl who used to come 
into his store in a long time." Granted, this is not as elegant as a trigger,
but not everyone can write them.    
   The point is that you interpret the looked at description as something more
than just looking, you can view it as a static conversation. You can then go
around the area and throw in a few room extras leaving a trail to where the
princess is. You can also put some extra descriptions on useless items lying
about to indicate where one may find the princess. Once at the princess, you
could have her relay a story of the location of a secret buried treasure in her
looked at description, a nice reward for the rescuing hero. You can set up the
buried treasure in a hidden container with no long description. Give it a
short description of "the ground" so they get the treasure from the ground, 
and only know where this object is by the tale of the princess. When your 
players stumble upon something like this, they love it.

#1
DESCRIBING 

   Writing good descriptions requires inspiration and imagination before all 
else. There is nothing particularly difficult about writing for a MUD, but 
there are a number of common, fatal mistakes new builders typically make. If
you read through this tutorial, you should be able to avoid the common 
pitfalls, and thus insure a long life as a builder.
   Remember that your job with descriptions is to create an interactive 
environment that the player sees, hears, feels, etc. This means that your 
number one goal is to be eloquently descriptive. 
   Writing for a MUD was once explained to me as writing a story for the 
mortals of the realm. As you go through the zone, it unfolds into different 
twists in the plot. Try imagining writing a small book when creating your 
descriptions. A few builders wing it, which I highly discourage. The best 
zones I have ever seen have always had much forethought and planning before
the builder process began. Do what works best for you, everyone has their own
style of building. Use it to your advantage.
   Use adjectives. Sad, Angry, Dirty, Nice, Morose, Gleeful, Enraged, Filthy,
Pleasant, Melancholy, Ecstatic, Pestilent, Comfortable, Depressing, Blissful,
Spiteful, Smutty, etc. A thesaurus is great for this. @Chttp://m-w.com/@n
   An interesting area will always attract more players than a bland one.  
There are many ways to make an area interesting.  Try to be as descriptive as
possible.  Do not hold back on writing extra descriptions.  Players are so
accustomed to not having richly described areas that finding an extra
description can often be a real treat.  Also, one oft forgotten thing to
describe is the door exits.  Describing all of these can give a feel of
standing out in a field and seeing something like: To the north there appears
to be a plume of smoke.  The fields stretch off towards the large hills on the
horizon.    
   Many players (both experienced and first timers) read the descriptions
carefully the first time they walk through an area, and having many extra
descriptions helps them fill out their idea of what things actually look like.
   When writing the numerous descriptions of the area, make them interesting 
to read! Nobody likes to read room after room of stupid one-line descriptions. 
Vary each description as much as possible. One of the greatest joys for most 
players is finding new and interesting rooms, items, treasures, and monsters. 
For those of you familiar with role-playing games, this creative use of 
descriptions and atmosphere should be quite well known to you. Consider 
looking over other areas you enjoy before building your own, to use ideas from
that area. Remember: You do not want to bore your players to tears.
   There are four types of descriptions a builder can make. Room, Mob, Obj and
extra. Room descriptions are simply what players see when they walk into a room.
Mob and Obj descriptions are what players see when they look at the Mob or Obj.
Extra descriptions are unique because they can be used on either rooms or
objects and can be seen when a player types "look <keyword>".

#1
YOU

   Many head builders prohibit the use of "you" in any descriptions. This is
done because so many new builders use it incorrectly. A builder can and should
describe everything without "you". But, in my opinion telling a writer not to 
use certain words is like telling a painter not to use certain colors.
   The key problem with using "you" is that it forces a player to think in 
your terms, not the players. Do not think for the character. Instead, write
descriptions in such a way that they will cause the reader to think what you
would like all by themselves. Innocent uses of the word "you" are easily 
written in other terms, and getting used to writing descriptions without it 
means you do not have to constantly be on guard for the incorrect usage. 
  Do not describe a player's emotions in the room, leave that up to your 
descriptive text to evoke the emotions in the player, since that will make 
things much more exciting to the player (do this by never using the word 
"you"). Some people believe that it is best to describe locations in the third 
person all the time (i.e., never reference the player). 
   Never tell a player how they feel. If you want a sad description, do not 
tell someone they are sad, write the description to make them weep. Same goes 
for scary, happy, disgusted, etc. You name it, make them feel it. Do not simply
say they are. Thinking for the character is one of the most common mistakes new 
and old builders make. Whenever you are tempted to write something that directly 
states a character's thoughts, actions, or reasoning ask yourself if it can be 
done a different way (it always can). Do not ask questions in any description. 
Remember, a player should be able to see what they look at as if they are doing 
so in real life. 

Here are some examples of "thinking for the character" descriptions: 
 
BAD:  You shudder in fear as you look upon the evil statue of Marhuk!
GOOD: The massive statue of Marhuk glowers down upon everything with an
      awful malicious expression. 
 
BAD:  You proceed cautiously through the tunnel, weapon drawn.
GOOD: The dark tunnel appears empty, but it is impossible to know what 
      might lurk just beyond the veil of darkness.
 
BAD:  The dragon is large and looks very angry at you.
GOOD: A massive dragon roars in anger, steam billowing from its nostrils.
 
BAD:  You stand in a big room, it is very dark.
GOOD: Shadows cower along the tall walls and almost seem to be moving. The 
      floor is made of heavy stones, which are very dark in color. The 
      ceiling is quite some distance above the floor, small objects hang
      from it, ruining the smoothness that is characteristic of the rest 
      of the room.

SWORDS

   This help file is designed to remove a few misconceptions concerning swords 
and swordplay of ages past.  The undertaking will be to discuss what a sword 
actually is and is not.  As we think of them today, the blade of the sword is 
constructed from a varying combination of iron and carbon.  When considering 
the material to make a blade from, there are two main factors that should come 
to mind.  The first factor is toughness, as in how resistant the metal is to 
change in shape.  This factor allows to blade to take and hold a good edge.  
The problem with a metal that is excessively tough is that it has a tendency to 
be brittle, meaning that when struck tiny pieces of the material break off, or
even have the sword snap.  
   The next property is the material's resilience or flex.  This is the 
opposite of toughness in that a material with high flex won't snap and chip.  
The problem with a material with excessive flex is that it will dent easily 
and can bend if enough pressure is applied to the blade.  It is the job of the 
blade smith to find a material with the best combination of toughness and flex 
so the sword withstands the test of time and battle.  I pointed out this fact 
to show how some "modern" materials are not good for making swords no matter 
how good they seem to be.  An example of such material is diamond which is the 
toughest material on earth but is extremely brittle so it would not be good to 
use as a sword blade.  Carbon steel is still the best material to make a sword 
from, however there are still many kinds of carbon steel.  The ratio of iron 
and carbon in the material determines how tough or flexible it will be.  
   A few other misconceptions about swords that are almost universal: 
   One is the mass of such weapons as the claymore and other large blades.  
In recorded history, there is no sword that was ever intended for use in 
battle that weighed over 11 pounds.  Claymores were generally 6 to 8 pounds.  
For some reason it is thought that knights lugged around 50 pound whoppers that 
were a foot thick and other such nonsense. Something people also are not quite 
correct about is the ability of swords to easily cut through hard materials 
such as wood and metal.  A sword will not chop down a large tree in one stroke 
or split an anvil, but it will do a great deal of damage to flesh and bone even 
if the victim is wearing armor.

WEAPONS DAGGERS OEDIT-WEAPON

   When you create weapons, try to help round out the distribution of weapon
types. What I mean by this is that there are tons of swords already in the
game, but not that many pole arms or flails. You are probably going to get a
few groans from the immortals if you create yet another sword while neglecting
the other weapon types. No weapon may ever exceed 20 pounds in weight and do not
forget backstabbing is only possible with piercing weapons.
   So often builders always make the biggest and baddest weapons with little
consideration of reality. Before you make a weapon, think about who will be
using it, how much should it weigh, how much damage should it inflict. Use
common sense. A two-handed battleaxe should always do more damage than a 
dagger. Otherwise, why would I be a warrior and able to use large weapons if
I can be a thief and use a dagger that does more damage? Warriors should have
the best weapons. Mages should have the weakest. Weight is important enough
to mention again. A weight of 18, means only a player with strength 18 or up
can wield it, perfect to make weapons restricted to only warriors, and it also
makes a mage with the strength spell very important. Each race and class has
their advantages and disadvantages, use them.
   Some permanent effects such as sanctuary and armor should be reserved for
armor not weapons, basically weapons would most often benefit the wielder with
some sort of detection spell, not protection. Also remember that some classes
should not use certain weapons, so weapons have to be within limits, or the 
game will be unbalanced.

NUMDICE DAMDICE NUM-DICE DAM-DICE NUMDAMDICE DICE DAMAGE-DICE HITPOINTS MODIFIERS WEAPONS-DAMAGE WEAPON-DAMAGE HP-DICE HP-BONUS DMG

   Different weapons, mobs, spells, and traps cause different damage. 2D5
means the damage will be calculated by rolling a 5 sided die twice. This is
leftover from such games as D&D. Where a questmaster determined damage by
rolling a die. <times to roll>d<size of die>.
   3d5 means a five sided die will be rolled 3 times. This could give a range
of results from 3 to 15. An alternate and easier to understand method would be
to think of the worse and best case scenarios. Example: 5d8. The first number is
always the minimum damage: 5. Because worse case scenario would be rolling ones
every time. The best case scenario, or max damage, is simply 5 times 8. Meaning
you roll eights every time: 40. So 5d8 gives 5-40 damage. 6d7 means 6-42. 4d5
is 4-20 points damage.
   The question often comes up as to what damage a weapon should inflict. I 
will attempt to explain. To understand damage you first need to know hitpoints.
A player starts with 10 hitpoints. Then they gain a certain amount depending on
their class when they level. Stock tbaMUD uses the following: Magic Users
gain 3-8, Clerics 5-10, Thieves 7-13, Warriors 10-15. So a level 1 Warrior
will have 20-25 hitpoints. Now, let us apply common sense. A weapon that does
25 points of damage could kill a level 1 player in one hit. While a weapon with
a damage of 1-2 points (1d2) would allow for several rounds of combat and a 
chance to flee. A level 30 warrior would have 310-460 hitpoints. So a weapon
with damage of 50 would be okay. That is why we suggest 50 as max weapon damage.
To keep things simple I would suggest weapons only do damage equal or double to
the players level.  

   Average damage is calculated by this formula: ((DAMDICE + 1)/2) X NUMDICE
4d5 = ((5+1)/2) X 4 = 3 X 4 = 12 points average damage. Which makes sense 
since 4d5 would give damage between 4-20.

#1
SPATIAL-ORIENTATION BIAS

   Do not use direction bias. Words such as behind, in front, to the right, etc. 
should never be used because you never know which direction a player is facing.
Use cardinal directions; north is always north. Do not assume that characters 
have been in this room or surrounding rooms before. For example: "This room is
even colder than the surrounding chambers." If you have not been to all of the 
surrounding chambers, or have teleported in somehow, this would make no sense.
Another common problem is "This path continues to climb steeply uphill." If 
you were coming from the uphill direction, would not it be climbing downhill?
   Do not use movement bias. This means that when writing a description, do not
say "You are walking on a path" because you never know. The player could be 
flying, levitating, slithering, crawling, stomping, or anything in between. Do 
not use time or season bias. This means that when writing a description, do
not say "The sun shines powerfully through the window". At night, that will not
make sense.
   Also take into consideration all the different races and classes. Some 
races and classes may not need air, food, or water. Some may not have feet, 
clothing, eyes. Pretty much anything is possible, so know the MUD and its
mortals before you start building.
   Try to make your area interesting for all the major character classes, not
just warriors or mages. Build in parts where thieves and clerics have a
special part to play. By the same token, do not assume all anyone wants is
+damage equipment.

ERRORS SYSERRS INVALID 

   There are many common errors new builders cause. To simplify things they 
have all been included in this help file along with how to correct them.

1: Errant Rooms
------------
 1: [ 1233] Rumble's Room

   The most common are exits to 0 (the void). This happens when a builder 
modifies a room exit but does not include an exit room vnum. These errant 
rooms are listed by the command 'show error' The fix is simple, remove the 
exit by purge exit in redit exit menu or by using 'dig <direction> -1'

2: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) doesn't have drink type as last keyword. (oedit-keyword)

   Another common error is caused by how shop code handles drink containers 
poorly. In order for shops to display a jug as a jug of <drink type> they 
must have the drink type as the last keyword. It is good practice to put the 
drink type as the first and last word of an objects keyword (older versions 
of CircleMUD expect it first).
i.e. a shot of whisky should have the keyword: whisky shot whisky
     a cup of slime mold juice keyword should be: juice cup slime juice

3: SYSERR: Mob #5 both Aggressive and Aggressive_to_Alignment.

   Another harmless error. If your mob is aggressive there is no need to also
make it aggressive to certain alignments since AGGR means it will attack any
player it can see. Choose to make it aggressive to an alignment or aggressive 
to all.
 
4: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has out of range level #.

   A simple one. Limit spell levels to the levels available, on TBA that would 
be 1-34.

5: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has negative weight (-2147483644).
   SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has out of range level #2147483647.

   These are really annoying. This happens when you use numbers larger than 
necessary. This will actually crash many older versions of CircleMUD. Just do
not do it. Use realistic numbers.

6: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) uses 'UNDEFINED' spell #.

   There is no spell zero. Either select a spell or put -1 for none. 

7: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) contains (5) more than maximum (3).

   When making a drink container you will set how much it initially contains 
on creation and the max it can hold if a player were to fill it. Common sense 
tells us that you can not create a container that initially holds more than 
the max you set. To simplify the max must always be greater than or equal to 
the initial amount.

8: Char is already equipped: (medit-s-desc), (oedit-s-desc)

   This happens when someone tries to equip a mob with one or more object in
a single location. HELP ZEDIT-EQUIP for all the possible object equipping 
locations. All you have to do to fix this is pick a different equip location
that is not used.

TRIG-ERRORS TRIGEDIT-ERRORS TRIGEDIT-MISTAKES

These are numerous and I will add them as people ask questions about them.

Make sure nohassle is OFF. Command triggers (and some other functionality) 
will not work for level 32 and above.
For mob triggers make sure the mob can see the actor, set INFRA in DARK rooms.
AFF_CHARM prevents triggers from firing.

As a general rule always use an ID (%actor%) not a name (%actor.name%) unless 
you actually need to display the actors name.

GOOD: %send% %actor% Hi there, %actor.name%!
GOOD: %teleport% %actor% 0
GOOD: %force% %actor% kneel %self.name%
GOOD: mkill %actor%

BAD: %send% %actor.name% Hi there, %actor.name%!
BAD: %teleport% %actor.name% 0
BAD: %force% %actor.name% kneel
BAD: mkill %actor.name%

Another common mistake is the mis-use of set and eval. 

GOOD: set fruit apple
GOOD: set num %random.5%
GOOD: eval num 4 * %random.3%
GOOD: eval text %%txt[%num%]%%
GOOD: set num 5
GOOD: set command %cmd% %arg%

BAD: eval num 5
BAD: eval num %random.4%
BAD: eval fruit apple
BAD: eval command %cmd% %arg%

TILDES ~

On tbaMUD a tilde is used in the world files to denote an end of line. This way
the files can be saved and read. Because of this adding a tilde in any of the 
editors on older versions of CircleMUD could make the MUD unbootable.

DISCONNECT FLOOD OVERFLOW CUTOFF CUT-OFF ENTERING-TEXT

   This commonly happens to new builders when they try to enter too much text 
at once in the text-editor.  To prevent this simply enter a sentence or two at 
a time. Hit return then enter another sentence then repeat. The MUD prevents 
people from entering large strings of text to keep the CPU from getting bogged
down. A return is required at least every 256 characters. If this is not done 
the text will simply be cut off and lost. So enter each sentence separately and
when done type /fi to format with indent.

APOSTROPHES

   The apostrophe is something else that is incorrectly used quite often. Here
are a couple of quick examples to show its uses:
 
Fred's sister is Doris.
Correct. This states that Fred has a sister named Doris.
Fred's sisters' dog is named Rover.
Correct. Rover is the dog that belongs to the numerous sisters of Fred.
Fred's sister's dog is named Rover.
Correct. Rover is the dog that belongs to the *single* sister of Fred.

Fyre asked his writing group about those possessive plurals and here is the
response from his top flight editor who makes her living in Switzerland
doing impressive loads of copyediting.

"The horses' manes" is correct; the "ess apostrophe ess" form is only used in
proper names: Travis's albums, Maris's pendants

My source is the Chicago Manual of Style, used in the majority of publishing
houses in the States.

And another supportive professor of English ... who has won several major
writing awards recently ...

"the horses' manes" is correct.  The possessive form of a plural word
that ends in "S" is formed by adding only an apostrophe.  The possessive form
of a plural word that does not end in "S" is formed by adding "apostrophe S,"
as in "women's hemlines."  

We rest our case. Now do whatever you want...after all, it is your area.

OBJ-NOTES OBJECT-NOTES BOOKS PENS NOTES QUILLS NEWSPAPERS POSTITS POST-ITS OBJ-TYPE-NOTE PAPERS TYPE-NOTE

   With Object Type NOTE you can then use the A-desc to write what you want 
people to see when they read it.  Players will then be able to write on the
note by holding a PEN. If you want to create a book I suggest using object type
OTHER. That way players can read/look book but can not overwrite what you put
in the a-desc.
   To make a long book you have to use the extra descriptions with keywords
like 1 2 3 etc.  Since the buffers can only hold so much text. You would need 
to include instructions, something like this: to read another page type read #.
The player would type read 1, and would actually read page 1, then type read 2
and so on.

STYLISTICS ELASETH STYLE

@nunpublished work  2000 Elizabeth Hoefling Last Modified: Feb 19th, 2004
     @celaseth@@tbamud.com@n

@cDisclaimer@n: The opinions herein belong solely to Elizabeth Hoefling. Some 
games look for different things when building, but overall any zone made by 
these rules should be good for most MUDs.

@cThe Beginning of a Zone@n:

The first thing to do when sitting down to build a zone is just that - sit down
and think about it. Every zone starts with an idea or a spark. From there, 
develop it. Pay attention to what kind of zone you want to create. Is it to be 
an exp zone? Gold/money? Equipment? Quest? A combination of each or something 
else entirely? Evaluate the idea. Would you want to play in this zone?

After you have this part worked out you're ready for the second step, mapping 
it. Some really neat people prefer to map with graph paper, but that's not 
necessary. Any paper will do. The reasons behind mapping are simple. It 
solidifies what you're planning to build into mud terms. Also, though final 
products rarely are an exact copy of the map, they provide a concrete reference 
for you to look at when the builder's block question rears its ugly head "Hmm, 
what do I build next?" Lastly, not all players have nifty clients especially 
made for mudding with auto-mappers, etc. We wouldn't want those poor 
unfortunate souls to be at more of a disadvantage than they have to be... and 
maps are highly important to knowing a mud, even if you keep them all in your 
head as a few players do. 

When creating your basic map, it is also a good idea to number the rooms on your
map so you can keep track of vnums by the last two or three digits as well as 
know exactly which room is where if you need to go back and change something. 
It saves you having to dig through several vnums trying to find that one place 
where you have to reconnect an exit. Just create each vnum with the 
corresponding map digits and it is smooth sailing.

Now that you have an idea and a map, it is time to actually start building. And 
this is where the term stylistics comes into play. These are the do's and 
don'ts of building that surpass simple knowledge of olc. Some of these rules 
depend on the kind of mud you play, but most are tried and true for a nice, all
around, every-mud-can-use-it zone.

@cElements of Style@n:

Most of us know that many players do not read descriptions, but that the mud 
environment would be ever better if people did. As builders, we want them to 
read because we're not only putting a lot of work into what we do, but because 
these descriptions and the areas they represent intrinsically represent the 
virtual world of your game.

All descriptions should encourage players to read. First, by being well-written
and simply bearing artistic merit. Second, by ensuring that they are absolutely
necessary to achieve the goals of the game! If your game is made for experience
and equipment gathering, and failure to read descriptions directly impedes this
goal, then players will learn to read everything. If your game is made for 
exploring or role-play, most of your players probably already read them - 
because knowing their environment is a basic requirement of play. In any case, 
builders exist to ensure that the goals of play are supported by game 
descriptions.

Game environments benefit from complexity, especially complexity that comes in 
a palatable form (such as simplicity). There exists a certain pleasure in 
discovering depth anywhere, especially if it is truly a discovery. Hiding deep 
meaning behind descriptions, areas to find, special items, unique nooks and 
crannies to spend time socializing, and hints that point to these things 
elsewhere outside of your own zone is an excellent idea. In fact, if you 
don't wish to be building descriptions no one will read, you should employ 
special secrets - most especially on games where knowing one's environment 
does deeply affect a character's development. No matter what kind of zone you
are building, keep it interesting throughout!

Most rooms or things that belong to a zone should play an actual part in the 
world. If building a residence does nothing but add rooms, don't bother adding 
it. It is entirely possible that small parts of the zone are there entirely for
flavor, or to provide a place of a specific atmosphere to the game for certain 
types of play. This is fine, but make certain that your zone fulfills the 
game's basic design. Plain and simple, if these elements do not exist, the zone
isn't interesting and is not worth building. 

I suggest having something special every three or so rooms, even if it is only a
minor addition that doesn't even connect to the zone itself. Such as finding a 
sigil of office on a door, or old burned bones in a ditch on the side of the 
road.

@cStylistics - Rules and Explanations@n:

1) Write complexity into your zone. If you don't write well, you probably 
   shouldn't be the sole builder of your zone. Instead, seek the assistance of 
   someone who adds creative merit to your descriptions. You can do practically
   everything from plot to secrets to minutiae, even write the zone in full and
   just ask someone you know who writes well to 'say it better' and rewrite 
   what you intended to have there all along. Novels have editors, and so 
   should any zone.

2) Add secrets! Reward players for participating in the game that the zone 
   represents. Always include at least one interesting thing per three or so 
   rooms. For example, have a bench in the garden or a table loaded to the 
   room. Many objects don't have to do anything, just break up the sparse 
   rooms. A good amount of these things should do something to enhance a 
   player's gaming goals, however, for the sake of forcing the player to read
   what you're taking the trouble to write.  Don't forget to add difficulty 
   levels as well. Not all secrets should be highly difficult to discover. In 
   fact, most zone-defining secrets should be the easiest for a player to 
   discern and puzzle out, harder enigmas become the reward for replay or truly
   deep thought, unnecessary for those of lesser time/intellect/interest to 
   simply relax and enjoy the game.

     @cNote@n: Remember that gaming goals define a game, so H&S zones will want
     to reward with good equipment or experience while RP games may wish to add
     something social such as access to a special area their guild can take 
     over with relative privacy, etc.

       @cRecommendation@n: document these somewhere for easy admin look-up.

3) Never, ever repeat yourself. Do not clone rooms without a specific reason. 
   Saving time or energy is not an excuse. Players who play in zones with 
   multiple copies of a description stop reading the descriptions. The zone 
   becomes monotonous, and hence the mud based upon it shares that failure. 
   If a zone bores people, why play it? Much more importantly, why build it? 
   We're talking about a great deal of work here. Changing a description by 
   one or two words counts as copying as well. If you feel that a teacher at 
   school would even consider calling your two descriptions plagiarism when 
   compared to each other, change them. Repetition is redundancy. Who wants 
   something they're working on for several weeks to be seen as redundant?

4) If a builder uses fantasy, they must make the relations necessary for 
   players to suspend disbelief.  Builders, of course, attempt to circumvent 
   reality and shape it to their will. Properly suspending a player's 
   disbelief requires acceptable explanations for it to work, ones that allow
   them to draw on their own experience and understanding of their environment.
   For example, let's say a player walks north and returns to find themselves 
   in a different place than where they left. Why did that happen? If this 
   isn't something a player expects as a result of their actions, or a reason 
   hasn't been offered to explain away the situation, the builder fails in 
   suspending disbelief. Instead, players think it is broken, or it is an OOC 
   attempt to screw them over, etc. So, if the physics of your world do not 
   match the physics in our world, inform your players through your 
   descriptions as to why their assumptions fail.

5) If a zone is overly complicated, simplify it. Creating something that has 
   nothing to do with promoting zone's purpose in which a player must solve to 
   gain anything from the experience only frustrates players. This does not 
   mean don't make the zone complicated or difficult, but use good judgment as 
   to what is overly provoking to a player in a useless manner. A good rule to
   follow is that if it is complicated and has nothing to do with a zone's quest
   or purpose, don't make it necessary to achieve that purpose. My favorite 
   example for this "abuse" is adding secrets and failing to leave hints in 
   descriptions about how to solve or find them, such as a maze without even 
   telling the player why they're in one or leaving any clue on how to solve 
   it. If they cannot achieve their goal without solving a puzzle, that puzzle 
   must be directly related to that goal.

6) Rely on words to keep it interesting. Don't feel the need to extend a zone 
   simply for the sake of scale. If you're pressured to write bigger descs or 
   make more rooms, relax. The best zones are usually very small and a 
   description's not limited to the number of times someone has to enter 'w' 
   to go down the road- you can say something's any size you feel like making
   it with words alone. Remember, words are the main tool of describing things,
   not special code effects, number of rooms, or colors. These things alone 
   never convey the feeling of a complete zone.

@cThe Polish @n(I.E. Picky Stuff)

1) Do not use the word 'is' in descriptions. It is generally accepted by the 
   literary community that the active voice is more powerful and eloquent. 
   Dodging the use of this word enriches descriptions in another way as well 
   as forcing you to use the active voice. It is easy to describe something as 
   it is red, it is big, it is heavy... and the word 'is' becomes repetitive. 

2) Do not to use the word 'you' in descriptions. It creates almost 90% of 
   direction bias and movement method errors, as well as the classic "telling
   the player how to think or feel".  In any case, the small percent of 
   innocent uses of the word  'you' are easily written with other terms, and 
   getting used to writing descs without it means you don't have to constantly 
   be on guard for these three blunders.

3) Never tell a player how they feel. If you want a sad description, don't tell
   someone they're sad, write the description to make them weep. The same goes 
   for scary, happy, disgusted, etc. You name it, make them feel it. Do not 
   simply say they are.

4) Be extremely careful when building with color. Especially if you're adding 
   it to your room descriptions. Try not to use more than one, and usually you 
   shouldn't use them in the text at all, only in the room title. On objects 
   and mobs this rule is more relaxed, but if it is part of what the player 
   automatically sees when entering a room, it is probably best that it not be 
   too colorful and should only have 1 alternate color in it. Color is the 
   hardest thing for many good builders to learn how to use properly. Don't be
   disheartened or surprised if asked to change even a minor amount of color. 
   If you use color, -always- terminate the color correctly according to your 
   mud's system.

5) Never put a period at the end of a room title. Write all titles as you would
   the title of a book, capitalizing all words except for a, the, and the few 
   excluded prepositions like 'of'. Short descs on mobs and objects should 
   always include the article or a measure word like 'some'. Long descs must 
   have the keyword of the object in it. In fact, it is usually best to write 
   the keywords -after- writing the short and long descs. A player should 
   never have to guess what the keyword is to affect an item. If they can see 
   it, they should be able to refer to it.

6) Never describe a mob that's loaded into a room in the room description, and 
   if the mobile is sentient (like a humanoid or race), it simply must be a mob 
   and cannot appear in the room description. An example such is butterflies 
   circling a bush. That's fine if the butterflies are not supposed to be 
   sentient and are not loaded into the room. You should never describe drunks 
   at a bar in the room description of the bar, instead put them there as mobs.

7) Always write extra descriptions and ALWAYS add at least one extra desc to 
   all objects including all of the general keywords so that the player can 
   look at whatever they pick up. Always. If your game supports a certain type
   of description in addition to the typical ones, such as exit descriptions, 
   use them consistently.

8) Any noun in the room description that cannot be adequately described should 
   either have an extra description in the room or outright exist as an object 
   to represent it.  This goes even if the idea of the object being of use is 
   a mere smokescreen. 

9) When building streets or any other generic structure with a name, give it a 
   meaningful or fanciful name. The Main Street is boring and overused in 
   almost all cities. Each city on a mud should have streets with unique names.
   Same goes for the "Central Building" or " West Wall". 

10) If you describe an object, mob, or anything else in the room desc, do not 
    add it to the room and vice versa. This means if I describe a table in the
    room desc, it should not be a visible object for the player to see in the 
    room. The reason for this goes back to the idea that you should never 
    'repeat yourself'. 

11) Try not to describe objects that a mob is wearing in their look desc, and 
    never do it if you're actually going to load the eq onto the mob. The 
    player will see it twice when looking at the mob.

12) Do not write about the considerations of a player or thought processes. 
    Don't ask questions in a room desc. Try to describe the looks of the mob 
    you're writing about in the look-desc. The trick of making a mob say 
    something when looked at can be handled with scripts, and a player should 
    be able to see what they look at as if they're doing so in real life.  
    Remember that your job with descriptions is to create an interactive 
    environment that the player sees, hears, etc. This means that your number 
    one goal is to be eloquently descriptive, but to do it in such a way as to
    simulate natural input as well as possible.

13) Never just describe the important things in a room, always try to describe 
    the room in its entirety, given the acceptable space. Do not focus only on 
    the information a player needs to know. Things that are important, like 
    that special hammer, or the doorway behind the painting should be found not
    because they are the only thing the player sees, but because of hints or 
    thought based on everything they see. For example, if I walk into a room 
    and see blank walls and a description that simply screams 'This object is 
    important, more important than anything else at all!', people won't think 
    on what they're seeing and will lose a great deal of the point of 
    descriptions in the first place. In addition, do not do the opposite and 
    make something else seem of importance that is not while trying to hide the
    true answer. Such misdirection will lead to player dissatisfaction... the 
    thing that we are trying to avoid wherever reasonable. 

14) Room titles should be original in nature. This means for the most part, do
    not copy room titles. A person should be able to look, and by title alone, 
    know exactly where they are. There are exceptions (like roads), but try not
    to make them too common, and you can break those room titles up with 
    prepositions, etc, as well. Ex: Thistledon Road by a Willow

15) Room titles should pick out the most important thing in the room or give 
    the room a name to go by. For example, 'By a Patch of Daisies' if daisies 
    are the most prominent thing or a name such as 'The Green Room'. Try not to
    describe the title in the description of the room as the only item in the 
    room. In some cases, if the room has a name, try not redescribe the title 
    with the same words. For example, if the room title is 'By a Patch of 
    Daisies' there really is little need to add the daisies to the room desc. 
    It is acceptable to do so, but be descriptive in these instances instead 
    of repetitive. 


@cRules of Practicality@n:

1) Make sure the zone has a main goal. Every zone should have one before it is 
   built. If it is defeating the necromancer in the tower, setting the prices of
   the local stables, giving someone a realistic role-play environment, or just
   killing everything in sight, make sure you know what it is supposed to be 
   before you start building. 

2) Anything a player can see, he or she should be able to refer to. Be certain 
   that your keywords are intuitive.

3) If a mob is not humanoid they probably don't have money, and don't go around 
   wearing all that much by the way of clothing. It is unrealistic for them to 
   have it, so don't give it to them. If you want to reward the player for 
   killing them, give them a pelt, teeth, claws or something to be sold. See 
   rule #14 for more info.

4) There should be between three and eight lines of text in a room desc. 
   Proper grammar should be used at all times in said text. Going over 8 lines 
   can be a bad idea because of the limit of player scrolling and how daunting
   that amount of information becomes in a single dose. If a description 
   stretches too long, don't hesitate to go back and cut points out to make 
   into extra descriptions. Extra descriptions improve zones, use them a great 
   deal! If a room does not have extra descriptions, it is not a worthwhile 
   addition to a zone.

5) Do not use direction, movement, time or season bias unless the ability to 
   recognize these things is built into the game. If you can write 
   descriptions that will only be seen in winter, writing a winter description 
   adds to the game. If this isn't possible, writing a winter description 
   detracts from the game, even if seasons aren't coded. If they are 
   recognized, and you're just too lazy to write descriptions for every 
   possibility, do not mention the possibility at all.  For a simple reminder:
 
     Direction Bias: This means that when writing a description, don't indicate
     or insinuate that a player is going or looking in any one direction. An 
     example of a violation of this rule is "The castle lies before you in all 
     its glory..." The player may, after all, be leaving the castle, in which 
     case it would not be before them, but behind, making the description 
     unreal.

     Movement Bias: when writing a description, don't say "You are walking on a
     path" because you never know, the player could be flying, levitating, 
     slithering, crawling, stomping, or anything in between.  

     Time and Season Bias: when writing a description, don't say "The sun 
     shines powerfully through the window" unless you can swap day descs for 
     night ones. At night, that desc is still the same, so the sun shouldn't be
     shining.  Seasonally, the leaves on a tree should not appear autumn reds, 
     browns, and yellows unless you can make that description only show during 
     that season.

ZONE-COMPLETION COMPLETED-ZONE COMPLETION

   Spell-check your zone before you submit it for the final walk-through. If
there are a million spelling errors, we will not look at the zone until those
are fixed.
   Make sure your Zone Description Room in <zone #>00 is complete. It should list
absolutely everything of importance about your zone. @RHELP ZONE-DESC@n for the
requirements. You can also use the extra description 'credits' if you wish.
   Be sure all your mobs have been auto-rolled by setting the level in medit.
This is required for balancing. Also be sure everything meets the standards
under @RHELP STANDARDS@n. 
   One last thing you could do to ensure you have built a quality zone is to
read or re-read TBA zone. It is too much info to absorb the first time through
and I guarantee it will give you new ideas and help you fix common problems. We
have to review a lot of zones with a limited staff so any help you can give us
by double-checking your own zone is greatly appreciated.
   Upon completion of a zone notify any of the staff and MUDmail Rumble. Your
zone will be looked over and corrections will be MUDmailed or emailed to you.
Do not take this personally. Everyone makes mistakes and everything we do is 
meant as constructive criticism.

ZONE-DELETION DELETION

   To prevent accidentally deleting someone's zone and causing conflicting OLC
access I have made the following guide.  If someone does not login to the mud
for over a year, and does not mudmail me (Rumble) to let me know of an
expected absence their zone may be deleted.  I use show areas to list all zones
and then go through one by one using "last <playername>".  If they have not
logged in for over a year I then "stat file <playername>" and check that
they have the proper OLC set, and that they do not have the NO_DEL flag (I set
no_delete on players that tell me they are going to be absent for a while). If 
they have not been on for over a year and do not have NO_DEL set I then "show 
zone #" to double-check the zone and builder assigned.  I then use r/m/o/s/tlist
to check if they made anything of value that could be saved and donated.
   Once I am positive it is safe to delete their zone I set their OLC to off.
"set file <playername> olc off" then "stat file <playername>" to be sure it 
worked and then delete the zone from the server withe the RemoveWorld script.

BITVECTORS NOBITS BITS

   Bitvectors are used within the code to represent certain values or flags. 
When no flags are set it is displayed as: NOBITS. These flags include such
things as DARK PEACEFUL INDOORS etc.

   NOBITS means no flags are set.

#1
GRAMMAR GRAMMER TIPS 

   Love thy dictionary. Be sure to check the spelling of your work. Medieval 
words can be particularly tricky and elude electronic spell checkers. A good 
dictionary, however, will help you spell archaic words. Whenever I am building 
I use our Merriam Webster dictionary link on TBA to check any tough words for
proper spelling. Test it out @RTELL M-W DEFINITION@n. We hope to add a thesaurus
soon! Goto @Chttp://m-w.com/@n until then.
  I have found that a good principle to make is to avoid the use of all 
contractions. For example, if you mean to say "it is", do not use "it's", spell
it out. This will help differentiate between "its" (which means 'belonging to 
it') and "it is". Another set of problem words to take note of is the 
"they're", "there", and "their". The first can be avoided because it is a 
contraction, the second is not here, but there, and the final one means that 
it belongs to them. One final instance to take note of are "to", "too", and 
"two". The first is used when you want to say something like 'the passage 
leads to there', the second should be used in situations where there is an
excess of something, such as 'too much red paint was used to cover the walls 
there'. The final one is the number 2 (two).
   As far as obscenity in descriptions is concerned, we have no problem with 
using it in humor or description. If your description involves the use of 
some slang or 'bad' words, no biggie. Just don't abuse the use of any words.
We don't want the MUD filthy, just fun!

BREATHE BREATHING THINKING 

   My final words to you as a future builder, remember a few basic things. The 
chances you create the biggest are slim. The chances for creating the best are 
always there. Finally, this is not a job. This is for your enjoyment and the 
satisfaction that when you complete your area that hundreds of players will 
walk through the rooms and enjoy what you have created for them. There is never 
a rush. Relax, enjoy, learn, and do not forget to breathe.

#1
BALANCE BALANCING

   "Game Balance" is a term that brings a different thing to mind for every
person that hears it. What is most important about game balance is to keep in
mind what each zone is designed for. For example, high-level players, newbies,
or small groups.  The objects and monsters found in the area should match the
level, abilities, and needs of the players expected to use the area. Most 
players do not like to be given vast treasure with no difficulty in getting 
it, but on the other hand, nobody likes to fight the most difficult mob on the
MUD and get nothing for doing it.  Zones should not be impossibly hard or
absurdly easy.    
   Understandably, builders want their zones to be popular, but they sometimes
attempt to achieve this goal by purposefully making their zone unbalanced,
adding powerful weapons or armor with no harmful side-effects or mobiles that
are easy to kill yet give massive numbers of experience points.  Such zones are
destined both to become very popular and invariably to bring about the death of
the mud.  Every zone, every room, every object, every mob, will be checked
before being implemented into the game.  Do not waste everyone's time, (ours for
having to recheck your zone, and yours for having to fix any problems we find)
keep the balance.

PREREQUISITES CONSTRUCTIVE-CRITICISM

   Do you own a dictionary? Can you write in complete sentences? Builders
are expected to be able to write decent descriptions. Good MUDs will not use
zones that are grammatical nightmares. The goal of the Builder Academy is to
develop great builders, part of this requires a grasp on the English language.
We understand English is not the first language for most people, but that is no
excuse if you wish to be a builder. Most MUDs are not going to spend the time
to teach you proper English. At the Builder Academy we will try.  But, it
will take more effort on your part than ours.    
   Once you start your zone we will review it and make suggestions to redo or
fix parts.  This is perfectly normal and should not in any way be interpreted
as an insult.  The comments you receive may include a lot of nit-picky details
but once you are an experienced builder and have gained our trust and respect
we will not be going over your work as closely.  Try and learn as much as you 
can from this test and review process. Keep it in mind as you work on future
projects. It is the most direct and concrete way for us to teach you how to 
build.  Everyone wants builders, but they want quality work more.  We would 
rather have one good zone than ten mediocre ones.

SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to see everything another player types or can see. This will 
be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'. To prevent abuse snooping 
someone is logged in the system files.

Snoop is meant to assist teachers in helping builders and to ensure players do
not cheat. With builders it allows you to see what they are doing wrong and 
correct them. It should be used in conjunction with the send command. Snoop 
shall only be used to assist people when building and enforcing rules. It is
not meant as a tool for spying.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.

See also: SEND
#1
SEND

Usage: send [target] <message>

   SEND displays the message to a particular person. This is meant to be used 
by teachers to send text to builders while in OLC. Combined with the snoop 
command this allows a teacher to see and tell builders what to do. Here is a 
little shortcut alias I use.

alias sa send alambil @M@@MRumble sends you:@n@@n $*

With this I just type: sa <message>. This will use color to catch his attention
and will list my name since send does not automatically show who the send is 
from.

Wiznet is now viewable while in OLC so if the MUD isn't too crowded you can use
that as well, but do not spam other builders.

EVERYTHING ANYTHING

When I help people I usually ask them what they need help with. All too often
they tell me: everything. I can not teach people everything. It is up to each
individual to learn what they can and then ask informed questions. The help
files here are extensive and are continuously being developed. Read through
all of the TBA zone starting at room 3. Inform yourself and then ask an 
informed question in which I or the other staff members will be able to help
with.

ABBREVIATIONS ABBREVS

   We have added abbreviations so you do not have to type everything exactly as
it appears. This also means that when you enter keywords in OLC you do not have
to list all forms. i. e. the keyword rumble could be used to cover anyone who 
types <action> rumble rumbl rumb rum ru.

ZEDIT-DESCRIPTION

Your zone proposal should be cut and pasted into your "Zone Description Room",
which will be in room <zone #>00 (first room in your zone). In this credit room you 
should update your zone proposal as required to keep a summary of any important
information about your zone. This room will have no exits and should only be 
accessible by immortals. It is there for you and the immortals that come after 
you to get a basic idea of the zone without having to explore the whole thing. 
If you have any planned links or possible exits or entrances to another zone, 
make sure that you list them there. For examples goto the following rooms: 
8600, 10600, 20000. Add anything to this room that you think would make it 
easier to administer the zone on a MUD.

PROPOSALS GUIDELINES ZONE-PROPOSALS PROPOSITIONS PROPOSE REQUESTS CRITERIA

Congratulations, you must have completed your first trial of building one
room/mob/obj. Your next task is to submit a zone proposal to prove you have
what it takes to properly plan out your first zone. It is extremely important
that you put some forethought into what you will be creating. Remember, zones
are built for others to play. Be sure to make it something a player will enjoy.
A zone proposal consists of an informal MUDmail to your Head Builder. It should
contain: the location, level, alignment, theme, plot, size, and any other 
important notes about the zone. Detailed descriptions and help files are 
available in the hallways starting from room 14 and 15.

One last word. No one here is being rushed to finish their zone, we have no
deadlines, so take the time to give your zone character.

Do not load mobiles or objects in other people's zones. Especially in TBA zone
and immortal rooms.

OFFLINE-EDITOR CIRCEDIT CWC 

   A few builders prefer building on their home computer instead of on a MUD.
I DO NOT recommend this since there are no good offline programs. But if you
do not have Internet access and want to still work on your zones feel free to
try them out. I have used CircEdit and the newest CWC seems to be even better.

SUGGESTIONS

   I have been MUDding for many years, I then became a builder, then an 
immortal, then an imp, and finally a coder. I am writing this because I 
am tired of seeing the same problems with the majority of newbie builders.
First of all I'd like to say that while building can be fun it is also 
hard work, a lot of people who have never built do not seem to realize it.
I have taught numerous people how to build. They start on one small area 
usually 50 rooms or less, they are all excited and gung-ho and get off to a 
good start but then somewhere along the line they realize: "hey, building is 
not as glamorous as I thought, it doesn't pay, and it is actually very hard 
work." 
   Then they quit, which I respect more than the ones who I teach how to build,
give them an area, and they sit around making a "special room for themselves" 
or take advantage of the builder commands and equip themselves to the hilt or 
they sit around and complain because they are not promoted in the first week. I 
do not ask for much from builders, I let them build anything they want, if 
there is something special they want that is not in the code we will put it in 
(as long as it is reasonable of course) I don't ask for long hours and I don't 
sit looking over anyone's shoulders, I don't even require a builder to have 
experience, I am more then willing to teach someone, what I am unwilling to do 
is let someone take advantage of me or my MUD which is mostly what I find 
happening with newbie builders. I know I am rambling and I assure you I do 
have a point and here it is: *drum roll please*
   Building is hard work! It is a form of expression and creativity.  What kind
of areas you build generally reflects on what kind of person you are.  You 
do not have to be a good speller but you do need a good dictionary/thesaurus.  
@RHELP M-W@n.  Sometimes building can seem like a thankless job and sometimes 
building can be a reward in itself.  Building a few areas, even a few good 
ones, does not make you an Immortal or an Imp.  It takes more than building to 
be one of those and it entails even more work.  Respect others and they will 
respect you. The more detailed an area the better it is. Always choose Quality 
over Quantity.  Put some pride in your areas, develop a style of your own.  Try
new things keep it interesting, if you become bored with building an area take 
a break and play a mortal or do something else, don't take advantage of builder
privileges.  Treat others as you wish to be treated. One more warning I would 
give to builders before they take things personally or get insulted.  Everyone 
has their own ideas on how to run a MUD, what it comes down to is whoever owns 
the MUD makes the final decision, so it does not matter how good you think your
idea is, it may never be used if the owner does not like it.  Plain and simple.
You see this on every MUD.  So please keep the ideas coming, but do not try to 
force them onto anyone.  Be constructive, not critical about peoples ideas.  
Everyone is allowed their opinions.    
Be original, finish what you start, have fun, and don't forget to breathe!

the capacity of the fountain. The first number is max drink units (-1 for 
unlimited). The second is the intitial drink units (this must be 1 or greater).
The 3rd number is liquid type from the following:

   value 0: Max drink units. -1 for unlimited.
   value 1: Initial drink units. Must be 1 or greater.
   value 2: see below
   value 3: 0 for not poisoned. Otherwise, the number of hours until the poison 
            burns off?

      ---------------------------------------------------------------
   The above values for drunkenness/fullness/thirst are in the units of one
hour of effect per four units of liquid drunk.  For example, imagine that
Dragon drinks an entire bottle (say 7 units) of saltwater.  According to the
table above, saltwater has a drunkenness value of 0, fullness value of 1 and
thirst value of -2.  Therefore:
His drunkenness is not changed ((7/4)*0)
His Fullness increases by ((7/4)*1) hours
His Thirst increases by ((7/4)*-2) hours, thus making him more thirsty.
A player's drunkenness, fullness, and thirst can range from 0 to 24.
24 is the maximum; 0 means the person is completely sober, hungry,
or thirsty respectively.

ALIGNMENT GOOD NEUTRAL EVIL %ACTOR.ALIGN% %ALIGN% %ALIGNMENT% 

   Different characters and mobs have different alignments depending upon their
way of life. Because of this, they may be aggressive or friendly depending on 
the mix. Some objects cannot be used by certain alignments. For mobs alignment 
ranges from:

 -1000 to -350  Evil
  -350 to  350  Neutral
   350 to 1000  Good

DESCRIPTORS LOGINS 

This annoying message happens when someone connects but never logs into the
MUD and is idled out.    

#1
STAT STAT-SELF

Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people with
names such as Red or Cityguard.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the players file.

STAT SELF will do the same thing as typing STAT <YOUR NAME>.

Examples:
  > stat fido
  > stat player Welcor 
  > stat mobile Fade 
  > stat file Rumble 
  > stat object thunderbolt
  > stat self

#1
BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

   These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites. Unban removes the ban.

Examples:
  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

See also: WIZLOCK

HELPCHECK

Usage: helpcheck

Checks all commands in interpreter.c to ensure they have an associated help
file.

See also: HEDIT, HINDEX
#1
HEDIT HELP-EDITOR

Usage: hedit <keyword>

This command allows online editing of help files. Hedit OLC permission is 888.
When editing a help file entry the first line must list all keywords. Do not
use /fi in hedit. Also, when editing an existing entry make sure to modify the
first keyword or it will not be saved.

See also: HINDEX, HELPCHECK
#1
PET-SHOPS PETSHOPS PET_SHOPS

   We are getting away from standard stock special procedures. Instead we are 
using a more flexible trigger to create petshops. @RTSTAT 338@n for an example
of a petshop trigger.

The OLD way: Make two rooms and some pets. The rooms MUST be sequential. if the
first room is 315 then the second must be 316. The second room is known as the 
storeroom. All that is required in the storeroom is to load one of each mob you
wish to be a pet. This room can not have any exits and will never be used by 
mortals. Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is recommended. After 
all of this is done ask your coder to implement the petshop. It will not work 
until the code is changed and the MUD is rebooted. The cost of pets is 300 
times their level.

#1
EXPORT

   Used by the IMP's to export a zone for other MUD's. This command replaces
the zone number with QQ's. This allows any decent text-editor to "find and
replace" the QQ's with a zone number of your choice. The zone will be saved
into a compressed file as: <zone #>_<zone name>.tgz i.e. 1_Sanctus.tgz
   Use your preferred client to unpack and then a text editor to find and
replace the QQ's with your zone number. If you want to keep the existing zone
number make sure to say so when you ask for an export. The easiest way to add
a new zone is to first create the new zone and then overwrite the created 
files. A zone consist of up to 5 different files that are located in their own
directories in lib/world/: <zone_#>.mob .obj .shp .trg .wld .zon

#1
XNAME

   The xname file is a list of names not allowed for players.

#1
LINKS

Usage : links <zone number>

   Lists all links from the given zone to any other zones.

See also: RESOURCES, LINK
#1
CHECKLOAD CHECKOBJ CHECKMOB

Usage: checkload <O|M|T> <vnum>

   Checkload will scan the zone information and tell you where any given mob, 
obj, or trig loads. We recommend you use this in conjunction with the lists to
ensure everything created in your zone is actually used.

> checkload o 15004
Checking load info for a golden apple...
  [15017] By The Throne In The Great Hall (Equipped to King Welmar [15001][100% Load, 1 Max])

> checkload m 3062
Checking load info for the beastly fido...
  [ 3024] The Eastern End Of Poor Alley (15 Max.)
  [ 3025] The Common Square (15 Max.)
  [ 3016] Main Street (15 Max.)
  [ 3012] Main Street (15 Max.)

> checkload t 100
Checking load info for the object trigger 'Portal to Midgaard - 100':
(obj) [  100] the portal

PEACE %PEACE%

Usage : peace

   Stops all fighting within your current room.

#1
ADVANCE DEMOTE

Usage: advance [target] <level>

   Advance moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.
   Advance can also be used to demote players.

Example:
  > advance Rumble 34
  > advance Rumble 1 

See also: SET, PROMOTION
#1
ECHO GECHO QECHO

Usage: echo <message>
       gecho <message>
       qecho <message>

ECHO displays a string to everyone in your room.
GECHO displays the string to everyone in the game.
QECHO displays the string to everyone with the QUEST flag.

Examples:
  > echo Hi, everyone in the room.
  > gecho Hi, everyone in the game, isn't this annoying?

See also: %ECHO%
#1
FORCE

Usage: force <victim | all> <command> <arguments>

   Forces a monster to perform a certain action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in 
the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in your room. If you are invisible to the 
one being forced, the force will be performed silently.

Example:
  > force fido drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look fido

See also: %FORCE%
#1
FREEZE THAW FREEZING FROZEN

Usage: freeze [target]
       thaw [target]

   FREEZE is used to prevent a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will 
ignore all commands entered by the player, including QUIT, until the player is 
unfrozen with THAW. Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme 
disciplinary circumstances.

#1
GOTO TRANSFER TRANSPORT TELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans [target]
       teleport [target] <location>
   These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different 
rooms. GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from 
wherever they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to 
some other location. For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specified can 
be either a virtual room number or the name of a character or object.

Examples:
  > goto 3001
  > goto Rumble
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

#1
HANDBOOK WIZHANDBOOK WIZ-HANDBOOK IMMHANDBOOK IMM-HANDBOOK

Usage: handbook

   Guidelines for having an Immortal character -- you should read it.
#1
HCONTROL

   Some major misconceptions about houses. You do not set any flags for a
house. Just use hcontrol to build the house, that is it. All the flags House,
House_control and Atrium are for internal use only. When the house is created
they will be set. Currently we do not use houses here.

Usage: hcontrol build <house vnum> <exit dir> <player name>
       hcontrol destroy <house vnum>
       hcontrol pay <house vnum>
       hcontrol show

   House control, controls the addition, removal, and payments of houses.
Hcontrol show will show all the houses currently defined in the game along 
with their last 'rent' payment date.

See also: HOUSE, HOUSES
#1
HOLYLIGHT LIGHTING LIGHTS TORCHES HOLY-LIGHTING 

Usage: holylight

   A toggle which allows you to see invisible or hidden people, objects, and 
dark rooms even if you don't have a light. It is expected most immortals will 
keep HOLYLIGHT on most of the time; it exists so that you have the ability to 
see what mortals see for debugging purposes.

See Also: TOGGLE
#1
IMOTD

Usage: imotd

   Displays the Immortal message of the day.  This file usually contains new
information on commands recently added, new features and other important 
information that immortals should be aware of.

See also: MOTD
#1
CHANGELOG

Usage: changelog <text>

   Allows an in game entry to the MUDs changelog with a date, time stamp, and 
submitter name. To view the changelog use the file command with argument
changelog.

See Also: FILE, CHANGES
#1
INVIS i30 i31 i32 SPOOFS

Usage: invis [level]

   INVIS sets your invisibility level.  With no argument, invis toggles between
making you fully visible and fully invisible.  If you specify a level, only
people at and above the level you specify will be able to see you. TBA has been
modified so this can not be abused, any action or communication you take will
show your name. 

Examples:
  > invis
  > invis 31

See also: MEDIT-AFF, VISIBLE, INVISIBILITY
#1
LAST LASTLISTS

Usage: last [player_name | all] [#]
 
For checking the last time(s) a person logged on, their sitename, and their
ID number. This now works similar to the unix version of 'last'. This will
display where the player connected from, how long they connected, and how
they disconnected.
 
   last without arguments displays the last 10 entries.
   last with a name only displays the 'stock' last entry.
   last with a number displays that many entries (combines with name)
 
  
Examples: 
 
> last Rumble
[    2] [34 Wa] Rumble       : localhost : Tue Sep  9 06:13:52 2003
 
> last 4 Rumble

LOADING MOBLOAD OBJLOAD MOB-LOADING OBJECT-LOADING LOAD-MOBILE LOAD-OBJECT OBJ-LOAD 

Load only temporarily loads the mob/obj. It should NOT be used except for testing
purposes. Use zedit to load a mob/obj to your zone.
 
Usage: load <mob | obj> <virtual number>

   LOAD is used to create mobiles and objects.  The first argument specifies if
you are trying to load a mobile or an object; the second is the virtual number.
LOAD has been modified on TBA. Level 31 can not load mobs outside of their zone.
 
Example:
  > load obj 3099
  You create a bulletin board.
  > load mob 3005
  You create the receptionist.

PAGE ALL to send a message and a beep to everyone in the game.

Examples:

  > page Rumble Hey, are you still at the keyboard?
  > page all GAME WILL BE SHUTTING DOWN IN 10 MINUTES

Do not abuse this command.

#1
PARDON

Usage: pardon [target]

Removes killer and thief flags from a player.

#1
POOFIN POOFOUT POOFS BAMFIN BAMFOUT

Usage: set self poofin <message>
       set self poofout <message>
 
Sets the message seen by players when you use GOTO to move to a different room.  
POOFIN with no argument resets your poofin to the default "appears with an ear-

PURGE DESTROY SACRIFICE UNLOAD DELETE-MOBILE DISINTEGRATE DECOMPOSE CLEANUP 

Usage: purge [target]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

Players can not be purged on TBA. Level 31 immortals can not use the purge
command outside of their zone.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

Corpses decompose after 5 minutes.

TIME TICKS

Usage: time

Gives you the current game time. tbaMUD uses zulu time 0-24 hours. There are
75 seconds per hour, 35 days per month, and 17 months per year. 1 MUD year 
takes about 12 days.

/** Number of real life seconds per mud hour.
@#define SECS_PER_MUD_HOUR       75
/** Real life seconds in one mud day.
 * Current calculation = 30 real life minutes. */
@#define SECS_PER_MUD_DAY        (24*SECS_PER_MUD_HOUR)
/** Real life seconds per mud month.
 * Current calculation = 17.5 real life hours */
@#define SECS_PER_MUD_MONTH      (35*SECS_PER_MUD_DAY)

SET INVSTART NOWIZLIST
  
Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>
 
SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.
 
SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.
 
SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.
 
The following are valid fields:

COPYOVERS

Usage: copyover

COPYOVER is a warm reboot of a mud without having to logout and then log back 
in. You can stay connected and you will be automatically relogged in after a 
successful copyover. OLC is not autosaved for copyovers. WARNING: All objects 
dropped on the ground will get lost and aggro mobs will reappear just like 
any other zone reset or reboot.

See Also: SHUTDOWN, AUTOSAVE
#1
SHUTDOWNS

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause] [time]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down with the following different arguments.  

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD. OLC is auto-saved.
 
DIE        Kills the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.
 
PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in the root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.
 
TIME       Time until reboot/shutdown. Omit to reboot/shutdown right away.
 
See Also: COPYOVER, AUTOSAVE
#1
SLOWNS SLOWNAMESERVER

Usage: toggle slown

The slowns command is deprecated after adding asynchronous host lookup.

Huh? Slowns toggles whether or not IP addresses are resolved into readable 
site names. If slow nameserver is enabled, USERS will show only IP 
addresses. i.e. 128.123.222.111 and not ip.hr.hr.cox.net.

The SYSLOG command controls how detailed of an on-line system log you see.
Messages surrounded by '[' and ']' are syslog messages and are in green
if you have color on.

The messages you receive are level dependent.

Examples:
 > toggle syslog on       - You will see all logs, spammy.
 > toggle syslog normal   - You will see all the important stuff.
 > toggle syslog brief    - You will see few logs.
 > toggle syslog off      - You will see no logs.

#1
USERS STATUS

Usage: users [switches]

USERS gives a list of all sockets (i.e., connections) currently active on the
MUD.  The multi-column display shows the socket number (used by DC), class,
level, and name of the player connected, connection state, idle time, and
hostname.

#1
VIRTUAL-NUMBERS RNUM  

    Each room, mob, object, shop, and trigger within a zone is given a unique
number called a Virtual Number or Vnum. These Vnums are independent, so there
can be both a room number 1300, an object 1300, a mob, a shop, and a trigger.
When defining and referencing parts of a zone builders always refers to each 
entity by its Vnum. Vnums are not seen by mortal players. Each zone also has 
a Vnum.  The zone Vnum for any zone is simply the room, mob, object, shop, or 
trigger Vnum divided by 100. For example, The Builder Academy is zone 13, 
consisting of Vnums 1300 to 1399.
   tbaMUD worlds are divided into distinct sections called zones.  Each
zone typically consists of a single region of the MUD's virtual world with a
consistent storyline.  Each zone can define its own rooms, mobs, objects,
shops, and triggers. A single zone typically contains 100 rooms, 100 mobs, 100
objects, 100 shops, and 100 triggers. 
   If I made the Sword of Cheezy Destruction, I may decide to make it object 
vnum 1300 of my zone.  The first two digits are the zone number of my area, 
the second two identify which item it is in that area. It would be zone 13, 
object 00 of 100 possible objects. However, never use any VNUM from someone
else's zone without the permission of that person and the staff.

#1
GCC

Several people have problems with configuring tbaMUD in cygwin the first
time. They will get an error saying "GCC could not be found" This means a C
compiler was not installed because you failed to follow the directions under
HELP CYGWIN. Reread them and add the compiler to the default download.

#1
POWER GOD-EQUIPMENT GODEQUIPMENT IMMWEAPON ULTIMATE UBER

   The majority of new builders begin by creating themselves the ultimate
weapon and armor. Go ahead if you must but it is pointless. As an immortal
you no longer need them. Creating the perfect items with every affection is
a complete waste of everyone's time. It will not be allowed into a balanced
game and will have to be redone. This is typical of people who are power
hungry and are building for themselves and not for others. That is not a
sign of a good builder (see @RHELP BUILDER@n).

#1
IMMS WIZLIST IMMORTALS IMMLIST IMMORTALITY DEMIGOD ASSISTANTS LESSER GREATER GODS ADMINS

Usage: wizlist | immlist

ZPURGES

Usage: zpurge <zone #>

   Allows a builder to purge a zone of all mobs and objects. If used once all mobs
and objs lying in the room will be purged. But, all objs carried by mobs will
be dropped to the ground. To completely wipe a zone use it twice.

#1
WIZAT AT

Usage: at <room VNUM | item | mob | player name> <command> <arguments>

   AT can be used to perform an action in a location other than where you are
standing.  The first argument can be a virtual room number or the name of a
character or object.  The remainder of the line is passed to the command
interpreter.

Examples:
  > at 3001 look
  > at fido kill fido
  > at 3.corpse get all corpse
  > at catje wave catje

CODING C++ PROGRAMMING LINUX UNIX 

   Coding is far more difficult than building, to do it well requires years of
experience in programming and MUDding. TBA is willing to offer limited help in 
coding and setting up your own MUD. Be warned, it is not quick or easy and will
take years to create a decent MUD.

   To begin you first need a server to host the MUD. Since free servers are far
and few between I recommend new coders start with CYGWIN. Cygwin is a Unix like
server that runs under Windows on your own computer. To install follow the 
directions under @RHELP CYGWIN@n.

   If you are serious about coding then you will need to read up on it. I 
recommend the book "The C Programming Language" 2nd edition by Brian W. 
Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. There are also online tools like:

LANCE

   When building, there are some things that separate a great builder from a
weak builder.  Items such as not using "you" in any descriptions, using 
Capitals in title (except for prepositions). For example, "Dracula's Room of
Horrors" instead of "dracula's room of horrors." Some other common problems are:
Not putting in Room Extra Descriptions (Command B) and not using /fi to format 
and indent after descriptions (in any of the edits and also in messages). To 
know the commands while writing a description, type /h. It will tell you what
all the / commands do).

#1
SNOWLOCK

   Not everything present in my zone was in my original plan.  I got a lot of
ideas from everyday life, unexpectedly, rather than from a quest for a certain
style or taste.  The only thing significant that I think I've done, which most
builders do not realize, is to keep my eyes open all the time, and look at 
ordinary things with a stranger's eyes, as if seeing them for the first time.  
Thus the descriptions do not end up as a list of boring details, but rather, 
exclamations of wonderful, magical, and perhaps even horrible things yet to be 
noticed.  

#1
PATHS

   When building rooms, try to allow characters some freedom of movement. Do 
not create paths and trails that force you to go a certain way without any 
choices. Try and let characters get from point A to point B in a number of 
different ways, if possible. One suggestion for this is to have one pathway
through part of your area, using exit, extra, and room descriptions to show 
where the path lies. This way, observant players will be able to find the path
easily, whereas those players that are not quite as observant will get lost 
much more easily. Such hints can be hidden two or three extra descriptions deep
and be as small as a scrape on the side of a tree, a thread on a bush, or 
whatever.

%DAMAGE% ODAMAGE MDAMAGE WDAMAGE TRIGEDIT-DAMAGE TRIGEDIT-ROOM-DAMAGE TRIG-DAMAGE

%damage% %victim% amount

   Cause amount points of damage to victim. The amount can be negative, to 
create a healing effect. This requires an actor to damage, so if it is a random
trigger you must define actor.

%damage% %actor% -20          - cause 20 points of healing 
%damage% %actor% 20           - cause 20 points damage
%damage% %actor% %random.20%  - cause 1-20 points damage randomly

eval stunned %actor.hitp%     - evaluate all hitpoints and then damage
%damage% %actor% %stunned%    - leaving the player stunned, but will recover 

eval num_hitp %actor.hitp%/2  - calculate half of hitpoints and then damage
%damage% %actor% %num_hitp%

%FORCE% OFORCE WFORCE MFORCE TRIGEDIT-FORCE TRIG-FORCE

%force% <victim> <command>

   Force the victim to perform a particular command. Cannot be made to force 
level 32 and above.

   This little trigger teleports the actor to another place when he enters the
room. It then makes him look to see the description.

Trigger Intended Assignment: Rooms
Trigger Type: Enter , Numeric Arg: 100, Arg list: None
Commands:
wait 1 s
%echo% A powerful force drags you down.
%teleport% %actor% 3001

#1
%LOAD% OLOAD MLOAD WLOAD

%load% <obj|mob> <vnum> [name [position]]

   This command loads a mob or object into the game. No-take objects loaded to
an actor will load to the room. NO_RENT objects can not be loaded.

load an object to room: %load% obj 1300
load a mob to room    : %load% mob 1300
load obj to player inv: %load% obj 1300 %actor% inv

See also: POSITIONS, CHAR-VAR
#1
%PURGE% OPURGE MPURGE WPURGE

%purge% <victim>

   Purge removes objects or mobs from the game. If no argument is given, then
all objects and mobs in the room will be removed. If there is an argument,
only that mob or object will be purged. Players can not be purged.

Examples: 
   %purge% %self%
   %purge% %actor.inventory(1300)%   
   %purge% %actor.eq(hold)%
 
When purging objects make sure the object exists. If it does not the room will 
be purged:

if %actor.inventory(700)%
  %purge% %actor.inventory(700)%
end

Always purge at the end of a trigger. If you purge a mob/obj at the beginning
you can no longer access that mob/obj variables.

Example: @RTSTAT 1375, 6300@n

See also: POSITIONS
#1
%TELEPORT% WTELEPORT OTELEPORT MTELEPORT PORTALS %TRANSPORT% TRIG-TELEPORT

Stock tbaMUD does not have an object type portal. This is instead done with
trigedit.

 %teleport% <victim> <location>

   Teleport moves the victim to the target. The victim does not need to be in 
the same room as the mob. If the victim is 'all', all the characters in the 
room will be teleported to the target room. No messages are generated by this 
command.

%teleport% all 17401
%teleport% %actor% 1300

PORTAL EXAMPLES:
   OBJ:  @RTSTAT 100@n
   ROOM: @RTSTAT 101@n
   MOB:  @RTSTAT 102@n

See also: MGOTO, TELEPORT, %MOVE%
#1
%MOVE% MOVE-OBJECT MOVE-ALL

In an object trigger, moves the object to which the trig is attached to the 
specified room.  The object can be on the floor, inside another object or in a 
player or mobs inventory (not eq):
Usage: %move% <room>

In a room trigger, moves the specified object, or all objects to the specified 
room.  The object must be on the floor of the room to which the trig is 
attached:
Usage: %move% %obj.name% <room>
       %move% all <room>

The <room> target room should be a VNUM.

Note: This does not create a copy of the object, but moves the actual object to the floor of the target
room.

See also: %TELEPORT%
#1
DG_CAST TRIG-CAST TRIGEDIT-CAST TRIGEDIT-SPELLS DG-CASTS %CAST% %SPELLS% %dg_cast% 

dg_cast 'spellname' [target]

   This allows the holder of a trigger to cast spells. Spells will work for 
rooms and objects, as well as mobiles. Players and mobs will still be allowed
saving throws against these spells. 

   This simple example allows the mob to cast poison 10% of the time while fighting.
Trigger Intended Assignment: Mobiles
Trigger Type: Fight , Numeric Arg: 10, Arg list: None
Commands:
dg_cast 'poison' %actor%

Example: @RTSTAT 132, 61@n

%ASOUND% OASOUND MASOUND WASOUND ASOUND

%asound% <message>
   
   The message is sent to all surrounding rooms.

Trigger Intended Assignment: Rooms
Trigger Type: Random , Numeric Arg: 10, Arg list: None
Commands:
   %asound% You hear a blood chilling howl from nearby.

See Examples: @RTSTAT 7505, 154@n
#1
%AT% WAT MAT OAT %MAT% %WAT% %OAT%

%at% <target> <command>

   Using %at% will perform the command in the room where target is found.

Example: @RTSTAT 19, 20@n
#1
MFORGET MREMEMBER %FORGET% %REMEMBER%

mremember <victim> [command]

   The victim is placed into this mobile's memory list. The next time the 
victim is seen by the mobile, the mobile will perform command if set, or 
execute the memory trigger if no command was provided. When the command is 
carried out or the trigger executed, the victim is forgotten.

NOTE: Any mob using the mremeber command MUST have a MEMORY trigger attached. 
It doesn't matter if the Memory trigger is never called (Narg 0).
Only Mobs may use mremember.

mforget <victim>
   Remove victim from this mobile's memory list. 

Example: @RTSTAT 74, 75, 41@n
#1
MGOTO %GOTO% %MTELEPORT% MTELEPORT 

mgoto <target>

   This command moves the mob to the given target. The target may be an object,
room, or  character, as long as it is not in a private room occupied with two 
or more characters, or godroom. No message is given. 

mgoto 1233
mgoto Rumble
mgoto fountain

#1
MJUNK %JUNK%

mjunk <object | all>
   
   The object in the mobs inventory specified is removed from the game. 
'Mjunk all' removes all of the objects in the mobs inventory. No message 
is sent by this command. Only mobs may use this command.

#1
%FOLLOWER% TRIG-FOLLOW MFOLLOW %MASTER% MASTER %SELF.FOLLOWER% %SELF.MASTER% %FOLLOW% %MASTER.FOLLOWER% %MASTER.FIGHTING%

Usage: mfollow <victim>

   The mobile will begin following the victim without the revealing "starts
following you" message. A silent follow. This sets the %master% variable on the
mob to the players ID.

mfollow %actor%

Examples: @RTSTAT 57508, 39, 26@n

See also: GROUP
#1
MHUNT %HUNT% HUNT 

mhunt <victim>

The mobile will begin to hunt for the victim, and engage in combat upon finding
them. Only Mobiles may use this command. Hunting mobs will ignore STAY_ZONE and
SENTINEL flags. They will also walk through NOMOB rooms. %kill% may be used for
mobs attacking mobs.

Examples: @RTSTAT 19596, 19595, 41@n

See also: TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE
#1
MKILL WKILL OKILL %KILL% 

mkill <victim>

   Mkill will force the mob to attack the victim. It is the same as kill, 
except mkill works for low level mobs attacking PCs, where kill might not.

Examples: @RTSTAT 23613@n
#1
%TRANSFORM% MTRANSFORMS OTRANSFORMS TRANSFORMS MORPHS MTRANSFERS TRIG-MOB-TRANSFORM 

%transform% < vnum | -vnum >

   This command causes the executing mob or object to transform into another 
mob or object, based on the vnum argument supplied. The transformation is 
permanent, though additional transformations may be performed. No message 
regarding the transformation is sent to the room. The new mob or object will 
have the same trigger as the original, rather than any trigger normally assigned 
to the new, and no load trigger will be executed.

   Mobs - The hit points, max hit points, position, gold, and experience value 
will remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions 
will be those of the new mob. (The mob can be made to have all of its normal 
statistics by using a negative vnum.) Only mobiles may use this command (naturally).

   Objects - Based on the vnum argument supplied. The four basic values will 
remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions will 
be those of the new object. The transformation is permanent, additional 
transformations may be performed. No message regarding the transformation is 
sent to the room. The new object will have the same trigger as the originating 
object, rather than any trigger normally assigned to the new object, and no 
load trigger will be executed.

Example: @RTSTAT 21, 1370@n
#1
OTIMER %TIMER% %OTIMER%

otimer <value>

   Set the countdown timer of this object to value. Useful for objects with 
timer triggers. Timers are reset on copyover and reboot.

Example: @RTSTAT 82, 11894@n

See also: TIMER, TRIGEDIT-OBJ-TIMER
#1
OSETVAL %SETVAL% VAL0 VAL1 VAL2 VAL3 %VAL0% %VAL1% %VAL2% %VAL3%

osetval <position> <value>

   Osetval lets you alter the object values of an object. The meaning of the 
values depends on the object type (@RHELP OEDIT-VALUES@n). "osetval 3 50" will
set the objects 3rd value to 50.

Example: @RTSTAT 79, 42@n
#1
COMMENT * 

* This is an example of a comment in trigedit. Because of the *'s the lines 
* are not parsed, so the trigger still works even if it has a lot of 
* explanations built in. All triggers should be heavily commented.

* The below line sends the text 'Trigger firing' to the room.
%echo% Trigger firing

   Comments are useful in triggers to document what is happening, for future 
reference, and for others to see what the trigger does. If you want a * in your
trigger text try \*.

#1
NOP NO-OPERATION NON-OPERATION TRIG-EXPERIENCE %ACTOR.EXP% ACTOR.EXP TRIG-GOLD ACTOR.GOLD %ACTOR.GOLD% %NOP% %POSITION% %POS% %ACTOR.POS% ACTOR.POS TRIGEDIT-NOP

   Almost a no-operation. Certain variable/subfield combinations for characters 
change some attribute about the character. nop allows those changes to be used 
legally on lines that do not need to process the result.

* this returns the amount of gold on the actor
%echo% %actor.name% has %actor.gold% gold coins.
* this will award the actor with 10 gold
nop %actor.gold(10)%
* this takes away 10 experience
nop %actor.exp(-10)%
* or you can use a defined variable
set number %random.40%
nop %actor.exp(%number%)%
* Experience can be modified up to 1000 Xp.
 
Can also be used to turn flags on or off:
nop %actor.is_killer(on)%
nop %actor.is_thief(off)% 

Player positions including sleeping, resting, sitting, fighting, and standing
can be set by:
nop %self.pos(sleeping)%
nop %actor.pos(sitting)%

Examples: @RTSTAT 1399, 20997@n

#1
GLOBALS GLOBAL-VARIABLES GLOBAL-VARS GVARS TRIGEDIT-GLOBALS TRIG-GLOBALS

Usage: global <variablename> 

   Global variables allow a room/mob/obj trigger variable to be used by another
trigger on the same room/mob/obj. i.e. a bribe trigger could global that the mob
has_been_bribed then when a player tries to leave the mobs leave trigger would
check the global variable to allow or prevent passage accordingly.

* To make a variable 'reachable' from other triggers it has to be made 'global'. 
* In this case I make a local known var %has_bribed_guard% and make it global. 
* It is a good idea to use this in conjunction with context.
set has_bribed_guard 1
global has_bribed_guard

Globals can be checked by varexists: if %actor.varexists(<variable>)%

Global variables should not be used when you want to remember something about a 
player. To save something to a players file for future use always use REMOTE. 

Examples: @RTSTAT 23612, 23613, 23614@n

See also: REMOTE, VARIABLES, CONTEXT
#1
CONTEXT %CONTEXT% 

Usage: context <number>

* This little trigger will make sure one %has_said_hello% exist for each player.
context %actor.id%
set has_said_hello 1
global has_said_hello
* now only triggers running with context = %actor.id% can access this particular 
* variable. however - it is a better idea to use vars set on players: help remote.

   Changes the "context" of a trigger to this value. When first run, a trigger's 
context is 0. When a variable is made global, it is given the current context. 
When a variable is accessed, if it must be searched for globally, a "found" 
variable must either have context 0 or the current context. The net result of 
this is you may have many global variables in a single trigger, with the same 
name, differing only by context. Players may have variables; this mostly 
removes the need for variable context. Previously, a player's ID could be used 
as variable context to allow a trigger to service multiple players at once.

Example: @RTSTAT 23612, 13495@n

See also: REMOTE
#1
EVALUATE TRIG-EVALS EVALS 

Usage: eval <variable> <expression>

* this example immediately evaluates the expression below and stores the result
* in %result%
eval result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
* this result will not change after the evaluation even if %self.hitp% changes.

   The eval command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the result of the immediate evaluation of the provided expression. There also 
exists a "set" command, with the same syntax. Set differs in that the expression
is not evaluated until the variable is accessed.

Example: @RTSTAT 49@n

See also: TRIG-SET, EVAL-EXAMPLES
#1
TRIG-SET %SET% MSET

Usage: set <variable> <value>

Set creates a variable without evaluating it. For example:
  set foobar 15 - 5
Sets the variable foobar to the string "15 - 5"

* this example sets the value of result to '%self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp%'
set result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
* The %result% var now works as a 'function' every time it is accessed.
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
%damage% %self% 30
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%

   The set command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the provided expression, which will be evaluated when the variable is accessed. 
There also exists an "eval" command, with the same syntax. Eval differs in that 
the expression is evaluated immediately.

Example: @RTSTAT 49, 41005@n

See also: SET-EXAMPLES, EVAL, OSETVAL, UNSET
#1
SET-EXAMPLES EVAL-EXAMPLES

GOOD:
@Gset maxlength 0
@n

BAD:
@Reval maxlength 0     * This doesn't need to be evaluated, just set it.
@n

See Also: TRIG-SET, EVAL
#1
UNSET

Usage: unset <variable>

* in this example we have a var %testvar% we no longer need:

set testvar hops happily along
global testvar
%echo% %self.name% %testvar%
unset testvar

   Unset removes the variable from the global variables of this trigger, or if not 
found there, from the trigger.

Example: @RTSTAT 70@n

See also: SET, EVAL
#1
EXTRACT

Usage: extract <variable> <word #> <string>

   Extract can be used to save individual words in a string separately. For
example a player saying: "Do you want chicken"

extract word1 1 %speech%
extract word2 2 %speech%
extract word3 3 %speech%
extract word4 4 %speech%
say %word4% %word3% %word2% %word1%?

Would say (Yoda-esque) "chicken want you do?"

Example: @RTSTAT 208@n
#1
IFS ELSEIF END TRIGEDIT-END TRIGEDIT-IF TRIG-END TRIG-IF ENDIF TRIG-ELSE ELSE-IF IF-ELSE NESTING

Usage: if (expression)
...
 elseif (expression)
...
 else
...
 end
   if %actor.is_pc%
     %echo% You are a player
   else 
     %echo% You are a mob.
   end

   An 'if' must occur before the other three. If expression evaluates to true 
(@RHELP EXPRESSIONS@n), the statements between the if statement and the next 
elseif, else, or end are executed. If it stopped at an elseif or else, it scans 
for the next end, and continues execution at that point. If the expression 
evaluated to false, it searches for the next elseif, else, or end. If it finds 
an elseif, it checks that expression. If it is true, it executes the statements 
between the elseif and the next elseif, else, or end, and then finds the end of
the block. If it is false, it continues searching in the same pattern, until a 
true elseif is found, an else is found, or an end is found. There may be 0 or 
1 else statements and 0 or many elseif statements in the block.

For anyone having trouble with the format of if/elseif/else/end blocks
Examples: @RTSTAT 22, 93@n

***EVERY IF NEEDS AN END: 2 IF'S NEEDS 2 ENDS....***

See also: EXPRESSIONS, NESTED-IFS
#1
NESTED-IFS

   A nested if is an if statement contained within another if or if...else 
statement. Nested if's allow the creation of a decision tree or flow chart
of events with multiple conclusions. 
   Always use /f to format and indent your trigger. This will warn you if you
do not have the correct number of ifs to ends. @RWARNING:@n multiple unmatched
if/ends will crash us. Make sure everything lines up with /f before you test.
 
Example: @RTSTAT 1490, 41000@n
#1
HALT TRIGEDIT-HALT TRIG-HALT %ACTOR.LEVEL% %HALT%

Usage: halt

   Halt terminates the trigger execution. 

* This trigger attacks players of level 20 and above. The reason for the use of 
* halt and return 0 is to make sure other triggers are checked too.
if %actor.level% < 20
  return 0
  halt
end
  %echo% %self.name% yells a Battlecry and throws himself at you.
  mkill %actor%

#1
VAREXISTS %VAREXISTS% %EXISTS% EXISTS

Usage: if %actor.varexists(on_quest_zone_1)%

  The above usage checks if the variable on_quest_zone_1 has been saved to the 
player file or to a mob (does not work for objects). It can also be used with 
!%actor.varexists(on_quest_zone_1)% to mean does not exist. This is useful on 
quests or other complex triggers that need to save variables to a player file 
by using remote.

Example: @RTSTAT 138, 139@n

See Also: REMOTE
#4
MAKEUID UID UNIQUE

Usage: makeuid variable id

* We have one mob giving a quest. This mob sets the targets id as a global on 
* the player via the 'remote' command, like this:
eval quest_object %obj.id%
remote quest_object %actor.id%
* We then have another mob receiving the quest object, with the following trigger.
if !(%actor.varexists(quest_object)%)
  return 0
  halt
end
* now we know the player has a quest_object variable
makeuid obj %actor.quest_object%
say Have you brought me %obj.shortdesc%, %actor.name% ?
say You must bring it to me to complete your quest, you know.

   Creates a new variable with the name given, whose contents shall be suitable 
for referring to a character, object, or room whose id is provided.

#1
RDELETE

Usage: rdelete variable id
* This is used to remove a variable
say Thank you, %actor.name% - your quest is completed.
rdelete quest_object %actor.id%

   Delete a remote variable from the trigger referred to by the id of its owner.

See also: VDELETE, REMOTE
#1
REMOTES VSET RSET 

Usage: remote <variable> <id>

Remoting a variable saves that variable to the player file for future access. 
This is used heavily for quests to limit a player to only performing it once.
Here is a quick example from zone 14. The variable must first be set and then
saved to the players file via remote, like:

* setting the variable to 1 means completed.
set solved_example_quest_zone_0 1
remote solved_example_quest_zone_0 %actor.id%

Then in future triggers it is checked if that variable already exists in the
player file. In this example, if it does the player is not allowed to continue.
<variable> should always be a unique name. I suggest always including zone #.
<id> can be any value or text you wish to use later.

   Create a global variable belonging to a character or player whose id is 
specified. The variable must first exist in the trigger that is running.

See also: RDELETE, VDELETE, TRIG-SET, CONTEXT
#1
TRIG-RETURN RETURN-0 CONTINUE %RETURN% RETURN-1
 
Usage: return 0

   Return 0 in a trigger will allow the certain triggers added flexibility. This 
is dependent on the trigger type and is explained in each trigger help file under
@RHELP TRIG-TYPE@n. The only way to make two triggers of the same type to both 
fire is to have the first one return 0. Other Examples:

Get, Give, Drop, Wear, Leave, and Consume trigs with return 0 prevents the action.
Command trigs with return 0 allow the command to continue to the MUD and not be
stopped by the trigger.

Return does not end the triggers execution. It is returned after all commands have
been executed, or a wait or halt command is called.

Return 1 is rarely used since it just means normal termination of the trigger.

Example: @RTSTAT 25, 13F@n

See also: TRIG-TYPE, HALT, WAIT
#1
TRIG-SWITCH TRIGEDIT-SWITCH CASE TRIG-CASE DEFAULT BREAK %SWITCH% 

Usage: 
    
switch %random.3%
  case 1
    %echo% This case has a 33% (1 in 3) chance of firing.
  break
  case 2
    %echo% This case has a 33% (1 in 3) chance of firing.
  break
  default
    %echo% default case covers any unmatched cases. In this case 3
	%echo% so it also has a 33% (1 in 3) chance of firing.
  break
done

   Switch evaluates an expression and looks for a match amongst the case 
statements that follow. If none of the following case statements are a match, 
and a default statement exists, the default statement is considered a match. 
If a match is found, the commands that follow it, up until a break or done 
command, are executed. 

Break is used to terminate commands in a switch or to stop a loop @RHELP WHILE@n. 
Case is used to begin a new conditional group in a switch block.
Default is similar to case but matches any condition not met. 
Done is used to terminate a while or switch block.

Example: @RTSTAT 35, 18, 6, 153, 132@n
#1
HASATTACHED %HASATTACHED% %ACTOR.HASATTACHED% %ROOM.HASATTACHED% %OBJ.HASATTACHED

Usage: %actor.hasattached(500)% 
       %obj.hasattached(1204)% 
       %room.hasattached(8371)%
	   
   Checks to see if the specified trigger vnum is attached to the mob, object or
room. Returns nothing if no number is specified or used on a PC (player 
character, i.e. non-mobile). Returns 0 if not attached and 1 if attached.

See Also: VARIABLES, CHAR-VAR		 
#1
WHILE DONE %NEXT% NEXT LOOPS TRIG-LOOPS TRIG-WHILE TRIG-DONE FOR-LOOP COUNT

Usage: while expression

   The while command starts a loop, running until the expression becomes zero, 
negative, or a break is used. The while loop must be terminated by a done. 
While loops are disabled after looping 100 times.

Room example: @RTSTAT 24, 2201@n
Obj example:  @RTSTAT 23@n
Mob example:  @RTSTAT 11858@n
#1
WAIT PAUSE TRIGEDIT-TIMING TIMING TRIG-WAIT TRIGEDIT-WAIT

Usage: wait <time> [s]
       wait until <mudtime>

* This trigger gives the actor 10 seconds to get out.
say GET OUT! NOW!
wait 10 s
mkill %actor%

   The wait statement is used to 'pause' the trigger execution for a period of 
time. When a trigger is being executed it will attempt to execute all commands 
right away. To get small breaks in, and perhaps give the players time to adjust, 
use the wait command.

Example: @RTSTAT 103@n

See also: RANDOM-TIMING, WAIT-UNTIL
#1
WAITUNTIL WAIT-UNTIL 

The wait until command allows a trigger to fire at a specific time.

* This trigger wakes the mob up at 8 and puts him to sleep at 9.
wait until 8:00
wake
stand
wait until 21:00
sleep

Examples: Mob  @RTSTAT 43@n
          Obj  @RTSTAT 79@n
          Room @R @n

#1
TRIGEDIT-VARIABLES VARIABLES TRIG-VARS TRIG-VARIABLES TRIGGER-VARIABLES VARS %VARIABLES% %VARIABLE% %% %TRIGGER% %TRIGGERS% %COMMAND% %WORD% VARIABLES-REFERENCE 
REFERENCES %VAR% DG-VARIABLES TRIGEDIT-VARS %VARIABLE%

Variables appear as a name surrounded by '%'s, such as %actor% 

Before a command is processed, the line is scanned and any variables are
replaced. First the list of local variables are checked to see if the variable
is there. If not, the global variables are checked. A proper global match must
have a zero context or the current context of the trigger. (When a trigger starts
running, its context is 0. The trigger context command may be used to change
context.) If a match is still not found, a list of 'built in' variables (ones
not declared by the trigger) are checked. If no match is found, the variable is
replaced with an empty string (the variable is removed from the line, and
nothing added in its place).

There are two types of variables, local and global. All local variables are
deleted when a trigger finishes executing, and can only be used by the trigger.
Global variables remain until removed with unset, the MUD is rebooted, or the 
trigger is removed. 

Global variables also have a context associated with them. By default, the
context is 0. Any global being referenced with a context of zero will be seen.
Through the 'context <value>' command, a trigger may set its context to any
integer; Globals created are always assigned the current trigger context. When a
global is referenced, if its context is not 0 or the current context of the
trigger, it will not be seen. This technique allows, among other things, arrays
of globals to be created by using a series of contexts as indexes. Also, it
allows globals to be associated with a specific character, room, or object in
the game, by using the id of the target as the context. 

Variable Fields 

A field of a variable can also be retrieved, based on their type. To get a 
field, a notation of %variable.field% is used. The valid fields are listed in 
the help files below. 

@RCHAR-VAR@n - Variables for characters.    @RTSTAT 27@n
@ROBJ-VAR@n  - Variables for objects.       @RTSTAT 28@n
@RROOM-VAR@n - Variables for rooms.         @RTSTAT 29@n
@RTEXT-VAR@n - Variables for text.          @RTSTAT 30@n

%TRIM% TRIGEDIT-TEXT-VAR %STRLEN% CDR STRLEN STRING-LENGTH STRINGLENGTH CONTAINS %CONTAINS% CHARAT

Text Variable Fields 

   These fields pertain to any variable that contains a string of text. These 
are often the variables, such as %speech%, which are provided to a trigger, but 
can also be variables that have been created by the trigger, such as 
%room.north% 

When using field - The variable returns
 
strlen     - Returns the number of characters in the string.
trim       - Returns the string without any leading or trailing whitespace. 
             This is used to trim extra spaces from the beginning or end of a 
             string.
car        - Returns the first word of the string. For %text%="this is the 
             string"; %text.car% will yield "this". @RTSTAT 53@n
cdr        - Returns all but the first word of the string, trimmed. For %text%=
             "this is the string"; %text.cdr% will yield "is the string". 
contains() - Used to check if a string contains the subfield text. 
mudcommand - Returns the mud command the string is shorthand for. Used to make 
             sure the command you react to is the one you want: For %text%="o"
             %text.mudcommand% will yield "open". @RHELP MUDCOMMAND@n
charat     - set new variable %text/var.charat(index)% i.e. set phrase testing, 
             set var1 %phrase.charat(2)% now %var1% == e

5%   =  4 minutes
10%  =  2 minutes
20%  =  1 minute
50%  = 26 seconds
100% = 13 seconds

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-EXAMPLES

To add life to the worlds tbaMUD uses something called triggers. There are 
three things in game that can have triggers attached to them: mobiles, objects,
and rooms. Examples of common triggers include:

Cityguards screaming 'PROTECT THE INNOCENT! BANZAI! CHARGE!', (a mob trigger).
A portal that teleports players when they enter it (an object trigger).
A room that creates a new exit when a player pulls a lever (a room trigger).

Every room, mobile, and object can have one or multiple triggers attached to it.
These triggers are activated by an event such as room entry, speech, commands,
etc. 

There are several different types of triggers. Each trigger type determines
when the trigger will be checked. For example, a mob speech trigger is checked
every time a character who is in the same room as the mob with the trigger uses
the 'say' command. A room enter trigger is checked every time a character
enters the room. There are two parts of the trigger used to determine if the
trigger's commands are executed when it is checked, the argument and numerical
argument (NArg). Some triggers use both; some may use only one of the two; and
some may use neither. The interpretation of these two fields is dependant on
the type, and is described in more detail with each triggers help file. @RHELP
TRIG-TYPE@n for a listing of all the trigger type help files.

When an event in the game occurs, each trigger in the room where the event 
occurred is checked to see if there are any triggers which are supposed to
react to that event. Only one trigger of each trigger will be run by a single
event. For example, if there are two triggers on a trigger, and both are the
same type with the same arguments, the second trigger will only be run if the
first one is already running. 

Triggers can be of more than one type. For example, to simulate a cursed item,
a trigger on the object could be of types drop, give, and remove. A more common
combined trigger would have both random and global types, so the random trigger
would be checked even when the zone was empty. Combined triggers must have the
same argument and numerical argument. 

The other component of a trigger is the command list. This is a series of
commands that are executed when the trigger is run. Commands are chosen from
two groups of commands, trigger specific commands and game commands. Triggers
specific commands are those commands that only the trigger interpreter can
recognize. These include flow control commands (such as if, elseif, else, end,
halt, wait, and return), and commands to manipulate variables (such as set,
eval, unset, and global). Game commands are those commands that a player could
issue from their command line as well as special commands added for mobiles,
objects, and rooms such as wake, east, sit, etc.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL TRIG-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL 

If you haven't already refer to @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-TUTORIAL@n. The process is
the same:
   1. Decide what you want the trigger to do.
   2. Make the mobs, objects, and rooms.
   3. Split up the quest into simple sections.
   4. Decide what trigger types you need.
   5. Write the triggers.
   6. Attach the triggers - permanently
   7. Done ? 

Decide what you want the trigger to do. 
   First determine the type of trigger you want: Room, Mobile, or Object.
Then decide what action you want to activate the trigger. Doing this before
worrying what can be done prevents you from limiting yourself to what you have
seen other triggers do, and allows you to produce a more interesting trigger. 
  
For this example, I want to create a gate guard for a small walled town. The 
ruler of the town has decided that each group of people will be charged ten 
coins to enter his domain. The gate guard must notify travelers of the cost to 
enter, collect the money, allow people who have paid to enter the city, and 
close the gate after them. This will be a mob trigger. 
  
Make the mobs, objects, and rooms.
Split up the quest into simple sections.
Decide what trigger types you need. @RHELP TRIG-TYPE@n  
   Our gate guard needs to react to four different events. These events are what
will cause the triggers to fire. Remember: a trigger requires a "triggering" 
action. i.e. speech, command, greet, etc.

1. A character entering the room from the south needs to be told the price for 
   entrance. This will be a mobile greet trigger. @RHELP TRIG-MOB-GREET@n 
2. When the guard is given ten or more coins, the guard must open the gate. This
   is done by a mobile bribe trigger. @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE@n I also want 
   the guard to give change and refuse entry for those without the money. 
3. When someone passes through the gate, the guard must close and lock the gate 
   behind them. This is done with a mobile act trigger. @RHELP TRIG-MOB-ACT@n 
4. When the gate is opened from the other side, the guard must eventually close
   it. This will be another act trigger. 

Determine the arguments and the numerical arguments of the triggers from the help
files. For the bribe trigger, the guard must respond whenever someone gives him
some coins, so Numeric Arg should be 1. The Act triggers should fire off "leaves
north" and "the gate is opened from the other side."
  
Write the body of the trigger.
This is the most complex and time consuming part. The valid commands and
variables are explained in the help files @RHELP TRIG-COMMANDS@n and @RHELP 
VARIABLES@n. Expressions are also used: @RHELP EXPRESSIONS@n 

For the greet trigger, I want the guard to inform anyone entering from the
south how to get into the city. First, I must check if the character is
entering from the south. If they are then the guard should tell the actor the
cost of entry. @RTSTAT 4@n
 
Under @RHELP TRIG-MOB-GREET@n we see that the variable %direction% is set to
the direction that the character entered. The percent signs around any word 
means it is a variable and it can be found in @RHELP VARIABLES@n. The two equal 
signs together compares the value of the variable to the word "south" if these
are equal the lines in the body of the if will be executed. The "wait 1 sec"
pauses the trigger for 1 second to allow the character to enter the room. (The 
greet trigger is actually checked before the character enters the room. After
another brief pause, the guard announces the cost to enter the town. The
indentations are not needed, but make it easier to read. You can auto-indent a
trigger by using /f or /fi. This is HIGHLY encouraged. Remember, every if needs
an end!

The guard must open the gate if ten or more coins were given to him. @RTSTAT 5@n
After a brief wait (so everything doesn't happen at once), the guard unlocks
the gate and opens it. The guard will close the gate after 10 seconds, even if
no one passes through it. For the line "give %amount% coins %actor.name%", the 
variables amount and actor are both set when the bribe trigger is called, these 
variables are automatically substituted.

For the first act trigger, I want the guard to close and lock the gate after
someone passes through the gate. The guard should wait briefly so he isn't
shutting the gate on the character's back, then close and lock the gate. @RTSTAT 7@n
  
For the last act trigger we want the guard to close and lock the gate when it 
is opened from the other side. @RTSTAT 8@n  The "wait 5 sec" gives time for 
someone on the other side to get through the gate. Next decide the order of the 
triggers. The triggers are checked from first to last. If there are two 
triggers of the same type, the first one run will be the only one run. 

There are is one set of triggers which are the same type, the act triggers. 
Since both have arguments that will not occur together the order does not 
matter. 

Write the trigger.
Simply use trigedit to create your trigger and they will be auto-saved for you
when you exit the editor. @RHELP TRIGEDIT@n, @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MENU@n for help

Attach the triggers.
In the OasisOLC medit, redit, oedit menus, use menu option S to enter the
trigger menu. Then select the triggers that will be part of your trigger. Note,
that order is important! If there are two possible triggers that could both be
executed at the same time, only the first one found in the list will be
activated. In this example. If you require two of the same trigger types to work
you must use a return 0. @RHELP RETURN-0@n

Test the trigger.
You should see how the trigger actually works in the game, and watch other
people interact with it. Often you will see ways you can improve it. 

@RGOTO 13@n and work your way north to test these out. Triggers 4, 5, 7, 8

TRIGGER-EDITORS

A trigger consists of the type, information on when to execute it, a list of
commands, and a list of variables. Each mobile, object, and room have their 
own set of triggers. 

#1
TRIGEDIT-NAMES TRIG-NAMES TRIGGER-NAMES

1) Name         : @ynew trigger@n

   Always use names that explain your trigger and include the VNUM for the 
mob/obj/room that the trigger is going to be attached to.  It is important to 
give your trigger a name you and others can understand.  This way others can 
search "vnum trig <keyword>."  This will also make it easier when using 
tlist and tstat, allowing others to quickly comprehend what the trigger does.
Here are some good examples:

Princess Shout for Help - M2229     --> Trigger 2204 attached to mob 2229.
Tutorial Example Quest Offer - M14  --> Trigger 1 attached to mob 14.
No Recall - R10                      --> Trigger 1201 attached to room 10.

#1
TRIGEDIT-INTENDED

2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
This is either Mobiles (the default), Objects or Rooms. While in most cases it 
is possible to make a trigger work for either one, it is highly recommended to 
only use the correct type.

0: Mobiles, 1: Objects, 2: Rooms:

#1
TRIGEDIT-TRIGGER-TYPES

3) Trigger types: @yGreet@n
This is a bitvector  of which kind of events this trigger is triggered by. This 
is the most important part of the trigger. It is here you decide if you want the 
trigger to react on people dying in the room, dropping objects, saying stuff, 
entering, jumping insanely up and down or whatever else you might think of.

This part is also the most important, in the sense that the rest of the triggers' 
info means different things, depending on what trigger type the trigger has. 

For a full listing of types see: @RHELP TRIGEDIT-TYPES@n

NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS NUMARG NARG TRIGEDIT-NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS TRIGEDIT-ARGUMENTS %NUMERIC% TRIGEDIT-NUMARG NUMERICARGUMENT NUMERIC-ARGUMENT

4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n

Numeric arguments purpose varies depending on the trigger type. For most 
triggers it is the percentage chance of firing. But, it can also be the 
percentage of hitpoints remaining, location of an object, to match a string 
or single word in the argument, or the amount of gold for a bribe. To find 
out what numeric arg does for each trig look up that triggers help file.

6) Commands:
@csay My trigger commandlist is not complete!@n
This is the command list, which contains the actions which take place, when the 
trigger is executed. The command list makes use of the @RHELP TEXT-EDITOR@n.
This is often called the 'trigger', and is actually a small program, executed 
step by step. In it, you can use different types of commands: trigger - specific 
commands, flow control commands - if this is a mobile trigger, you can use 
standard mud commands like say or give.

TRIGEDIT-MOB-TUTORIAL TRIGEDIT-TUTORIAL MOB-TUTORIAL 

This mini-quest is setup in TBA as an example. @RGOTO 13@n and work your way 
north with nohassle off. Be sure you know how to use the @RTSTAT@n and @RSTAT@n 
commands.
 
The following 7 steps should give you a general idea about what to do, and how 
to go about making small quests with trigedit. This example concentrates on 
quests involving mobs. 

The process can be broken down to the following:  
   1. Decide what you want the trigger to do.
   2. Make corresponding mobs, objects, and rooms.
   3. Split up the quest into simple sections.
   4. Decide which trigger types you need.
   5. Write the triggers.
   6. Attach the triggers - permanently
   7. Done ? 
   
1. Decide what you want the trigger to do.  
   In this example, we want to make a small mini quest in an area. The quest 
will work like this: When you enter the room with the questmaster it will start
to tell a tale. In this tale, you are instructed to perform a task. In this 
case kill an ogre that lives nearby. As proof of the kill, you must bring back 
the ogre's wings and give them to the questmaster. 

2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.  
      1 Questgiver mob - I've chosen 'the questmaster' - vnum 14
      1 Target mob - In this case 'a quest ogre' - vnum 16
      1 Quest object - 'a pair of wings' - vnum 14 

3. Split up the quest.  
   Next thing to do is look at the different steps involved with the quest. In 
this example, we have three steps: 
   Player entering room -> tell story 
   Player finds and kills ogre -> load object
   Player gives questmaster the wings -> reward player 

4. Find corresponding trigger types.  
   Having split the quest up it makes it easy to decide which triggers to use 
from @RHELP TRIG-TYPE@n:
   mob GREET trigger (attached to questmaster) @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-GREET@N
   mob DEATH trigger (attached to ogre) @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-DEATH@N
   mob RECEIVE trigger (attached to questmaster) @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-RECEIVE@N
 
5. Write the triggers.  
    Up to this point trigedit should not have been used. Most people struggle
with triggers because they have not planned what they want to happen or do not
know what trigedit is capable of. Read the help files of each type and ask for
help if you need it. Remember, most of the work required with triggers is 
planning! You must know exactly what you want to do before you do it. Now that
we know exactly what we want to do we can use trigedit.

Trigger Editor [1]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example Quest Offer - 14@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yGreet @n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* we don't want him to tell this to mobs. Check if actor is a player.
if %actor.is_pc%
  * only greet players coming from the south.
  if %direction% == south
    * wait 1 second, always give the player time before you start sending text.
    wait 1 sec
    say Can you help me, %actor.name%?
    wait 1 sec
    say An ogre has something of mine.
    wait 1 sec
    say If you slay him I'll give you all the coins I can spare.
    wait 1 sec
    say Please, bring me the wings he has stolen.
  end
end@n

The trigger above will fire when a player enters the room from the south. If a
mobile enters the if check at the beginning will be false and the trigger will
not execute. Note how I named the trigger. ALWAYS include the VNUM of where you 
plan on attaching the trigger. Also, give it a name so it is easy to understand
where it is used. Now for the second trigger:

> trigedit 2
Trigger Editor [2]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example Kill Ogre - 16@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yDeath@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@csay you got the best of me %actor.name%.
* load the wings
%load% obj 1
* reload the mob for the next questor
%load% mob 16@n

The above trigger will be executed when the mob is killed - just before the 
death cry. The last trigger just needs to check if the object handed over is 
the correct one. Let's see it, here with vnum 2: 

> trigedit 3
Trigger Editor [3]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example Completion - 14@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yReceive@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* check if this was indeed the right object
if %object.vnum% == 1
  wait 1 sec
  say Thank you, %actor.name%
  %send% %actor% %self.name% gives you a gold piece.
  %echoaround% %actor% %actor.name% is rewarded for his valor.
  nop %actor.gold(1)%
  wait 5 sec
  %purge% obj 1
else
  * this wasn't the right object - don't accept it
  say I don't want that - bring me back my wings.
  return 0
end@n

First check if the object is the correct vnum, then give the reward, and send 
messages to the player and others in the room. If it wasn't the object, reject 
it, and use return 0 to prevent the object from leaving the players inventory. 
Lastly, and very importantly, 'end' the if. Every if must have an end.

6. Attach the triggers - permanently  
   Proceed and add the triggers to the two mobiles through medit: 

> medit 14
[medit menu]
Enter choice ? S
     Script Editor

     Trigger List:
     <none>

 N)  New trigger for this script
 D)  Delete a trigger in this script
 X)  Exit Script Editor

     Enter choice :
Here, add the scripts by typing N, then the trigger vnum: 
Enter choice : n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 1
Enter choice ? n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 3
Enter choice ? x

And add the trigger (vnum 2) to the ogre (vnum 16) in a similar manner. 

7. Done ?  
   The triggers are now attached to the correct mobs, and the players of your 
mud can now take the quest whenever they wish. This is a great time for 
considering improvements to the little quest: 

Balance issues: 
   Should players get a smaller reward if they perform the quest many times ? 
   Should it be limited to 1 quest per player or 1 per reboot ? 
Gameplay issues: 
   Perhaps other mobs in town should tell the player to go see the questmaster ? 
   Should the ogre always load the object, or only when people know he has it ? 
   Are there other mobs who would like to pay for that object ? 

The above list is just a few examples. All of them could be implemented, but 
it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

   Trigedit can be used to create various games. Feel free to experiment and give
me more examples.

Examples: @RTSTAT 13899, 13420@n
#1
TSTAT EXAMPLES TRIGSTAT TRIGGERSTAT

Usage: tstat <trigger vnum>

Tstat lets you learn more about a specific trigger. 
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could have 
made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 0 are the basic examples. For 
more examples check out zones 0, 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 19, 27, 29, 30, 77, 236 and 
237. There are numerous others.  

To learn more about any of these just tlist <zone #> then tstat each
trigger individually. You can always ask Rumble to find you an example.

Other Examples: TRIG-EXAMPLES 
#1
ATTACH

Builders working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.

Usage: attach mob {trigger vnum/name} {mob name} [location]
       attach obj {trigger vnum/name} {obj name} [location]
       attach room {trigger vnum/name} {room vnum} [location]

   Attach lets you attach a trigger to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for
testing or other purposes. The command only attaches the trigger once,
and will not last over a reboot (or crash).

The 'location' is what number in the triggerlist the trigger will assume.
It is important to first attach a trigger to test before you manually add it
through oedit/medit/redit. 

Examples:
attach room 14500 14520 - Attaches room trigger 14500 to room 14520.
attach mob 1332 Santa   - Attaches mob trigger 1332 to mob 1308 (Santa).
attach obj 1480 sword   - Attaches obj trigger 1480 to a sword.

#1
DETACH UNATTACH 

Builders working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   

Fizban: Usage: detach [mob | obj] {target name} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}
> 
Fizban: detach room {target vnum | '.'} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}
> 
Fizban: syntax is actually detach room {trig vnum} {room vnum}   etc


Usage: detach [mob | obj | target name/vnum] {trig vnum | 'all'}
       detach room {trig vnum | '.'} {room vnum | 'all'}

   Detach removes a trigger to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for testing or 
other purposes. The command only removes the trigger temporarily, until the
room/obj/mob is reloaded via reboot, zreset, load.

Use the optional arguments 'mob' and 'obj' to differentiate if more entities
with the same alias are in the room.

Examples:
detach room 14500 14520 - remove trigger 14500 from room 14520.
detach room all         - removes all triggers from a room.
detach Santa 1332       - detach trigger 1332 from mob 1308 (Santa).
detach mob Santa all    - detach all triggers from Santa.
detach Santa all        - Same as above.
detach sword 1300       - detach trigger 1300 from sword.
detach obj sword 1300   - You guessed it - same as above.
detach sword all        - detach all triggers from the sword.

#1
TRIG-ATTACH %ATTACH% DG_ATTACH TRIG_ATTACH

Usage: attach vnum id
* This small trigger will attach a trigger to the carrier this can for instance 
* be used if you want the mob to change attitude by adding another trigger 
* (ie - mob was mad - mob got apple - mob gets a 'nicer' trigger attached
attach 3001 %self.id% 

   This command allows a trigger to attach a trigger (referenced by vnum) to 
anything capable of receiving triggers, by id number. (%self.id%, %object.id%, 
and %actor.id% are examples of id numbers, for use with this command.)

Example: @RTSTAT 1345@n

See also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-DETACH
#1
TRIG-DETACH %DETACH%

Usage: detach <vnum | all> id
* if we - as described in the attach example, want our mob/obj/room to behave
* differently, it is not always enough to just add another trigger with attach.
* it might be necessary to remove some old ones :
detach 3000 %self.id%
or
detach all %self.id%

   The opposite of attach, this removes triggers from the specified target.

Example: @RTSTAT 45@n

TRIGEDIT-ARRAYS ARRAYS TRIG-ARRAYS

   Trigedit can use arrays to store information. An array is a variable that 
can hold more than one piece of information at a time. Arrays are used to store
a list of variables.

For Example:   set  textarray[1] a string of text.
Would store "a string of text." in textarray position 1. You can have numerous
positions to an array. See the examples below.

DG_AFFECTS DGAFFECT SCRIPT-AFFLICTED AFFLICTED DG-AFFECTS DG-AFFECTS %DG_AFFECT% DG-EFFECT DG_EFFECT DURATIONS TRIG-AFFECTS

Usage:  dg_affect <target> <property> <value | off> <duration>

Modifies an affection or apply on the target. Duration should be in hours and
must be non-zero.

dg_affect %actor% sanct on 20    -- Sets sanctuary on actor for 20 hours.
dg_affect %actor% maxhit 100 20  -- Sets maxhit on actor +100 for 20 hours.

To check to see if an actor has an affection use affect(). i.e. if %affect(blind)%

TEXT-EDITOR TEXTEDITOR /d /i /h /s /a /c /ra /l /fi /d1 /p WORDWRAP WORD-WRAP FORMATTING REPLACE /e# DELETE-LINE REMOVE-LINE LINES INDENT

   The text editor is what you use to write room/mob/obj/extra descriptions,
mudmails, and even boards. It allows you more commands than the typical entry.
To learn the commands while using the text editor, type /h. It will tell you
what all the / commands do. Always use /fi to format, indent, and word wrap.
It looks much better to see writing that is formatted than one that runs all
over the place wrapping around etc. Just simply type /fi on a new line and hit
enter. Before you save type /l to list the buffer and see for yourself how it
looks. Fix as needed.
   When entering the text editor for the first time make sure to use /c to clear
the current contents. Indent and format all descriptions by typing /fi (format
with indent) in the text editor.  This includes all forms of OLC, mudmails,
boards, and anywhere else you use the text editor. This will indent the line
by 3 spaces and wrap your text at less than 80 characters so telnet users can
read it.
 
Editor command formats: /<letter>
 
@n/a         -  aborts the editor and changes are lost.
@n/c         -  clears the buffer.
@n/d#        -  deletes line #, or a range #-#.
@n/e# <text> -  changes the line at # with <text>.
@n/f         -  formats text. 
@n/fi        -  indented formatting of text (highly recommended for all desc's).
                paragraphs can be formatted by /f 1-4 (first from lines 1-4, 
                and /f 5-9 (second from lines 5-9).
@n/h         -  list text editor commands.
@n/i# <text> -  inserts <text> before line #.
@n/l         -  lists buffer.
@n/n         -  lists buffer with line numbers, or a range #-#.
@n/r 'a' 'b' -  replace 1st occurence of text <a> in buffer with text.
@n/ra 'a' 'b'-  replace all occurences of text <a> within buffer with text.
                usage: /ra 'pattern' 'replacement'
@n/s         -  saves the text and exits the editor.

NOTE: /f and /fi in trigedit will auto indent your trigger. PLEASE USE IT.

Commands such as /r, /n, /e#, /i#, /d# are invaluable and will make your job
much easier. For example, say you mistype "the" with "teh" in a 10 line
description. Instead of /c (clearing) the text you can /r 'teh' 'the' or if it
was on line 5 you can type /e5 <line with teh spelled correctly> or /d5. Learn
all these options.

Warning: Some clients will give you problems since they use special characters 
like the / character (MUDMaster 2k, Avplay, Mush, and SimpleMU).

DEPENDENT ZEDIT-DEPENDENT DEPENDANT ZEDIT-DEPENDANT

   One of the most common mistakes by new builders is their misunderstanding
of: "Is this command dependent on the success of the previous one? (y/n)."
What this is asking is: does it rely on the command preceding it? Or do you
only want this to execute when the line prior to it does. For example if you 
are giving an object to a mob, equipping a mob, or putting something inside 
an object, IT MUST BE DEPENDENT on that mob/obj first loading. So you
should answer yes. IF you are loading a mob, closing a door or loading an
object to a room it would normally not be. There are too many instances to
describe every one so try to use common sense. When loading an object to a
mob maxload should be 99. Since the equip or give option in zedit will be
dependent on the mob first loading only 1 item will be given when it loads.
Unlike the load to room command where you should not set a maxload of 99
because 99 objects will load to that room.

#1
MAXLOADED MAX-LOADED ZEDIT-MAXLOADED ZEDIT-MISTAKES 

   A mistake most new builders make is the misunderstanding of "Max allowed"
on the mud. What it means by max allowed is simply if this many exists on the 
mud, do not load anymore. So if you want 1 shopkeeper. Set it to one. If you 
want 10 Kobolds set it to 10. The same goes for objects. In both cases never
put a max of over 99. This is just a good practice and prevents 1000's of the
same mobs or objects making a MUD look generic.
   Actual mob loading gets a little trickier. Because if you set it to 10 
Kobolds in one room, then every time that zone resets another Kobold will be 
loaded until you have 10 within that one room. So you need to disperse them. 
You can do this by setting 5 different load mob commands in 5 different rooms.
All with a max load of 10. The first time the zone resets. 5 Kobolds will be 
loaded in 5 different rooms. The second time another 5 Kobolds will be loaded 
into those same rooms. So now you would have 5 rooms with 2 Kobolds in each. 
Next zone reset - nothing changes unless some players come along and kills some
Kobolds.  An object in a players rent file does not count as in the game.

PERMISSIONS

   Access to the Oasis commands are controlled through a number of means.  
Of course, the master command list (in interpreter.c) specifies the minimum
level for a player to call the command.  This is typically set to either
LVL_BUILDER, or LVL_GOD.  A few commands are restricted to the implementor.

A player can always edit a zone and its contents if their name is in the
zone builders list (see ZEDIT for more information).  Finally, a player
may be granted OLC rights to a specific zone by means of the "set" command,
using "set <player> olc <zone>".

The implementor has unfettered access to all Oasis commands.

BUILDWALKING BUILD-WALKING DIGWALK WALKDIG

Builders working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   

Usage: buildwalk

   BuildWalk is an OLC utility that will allow a builder to enable a
"buildwalking" mode.  In this mode, walking in a direction that doesn't exist
will find the next free room in the zone, create the room, and make a two-way
exit between the room the builder was standing in, and the new room. This way
a builder can create a framework of their zone by walking around.
   Buildwalking can be a little misleading. A builder can not walk n, e, s, w,
and end up in the same room they started. Buildwalk is not spatially aware of
other rooms. It will always create a new room if you walk in a direction 
without a current exit. It is often necessary to backtrack to prevent
overlapping rooms.

NOTE: Buildwalk does not autosave on exit. You must type SAVEALL. This way if
      you mess up and want the rooms deleted we can just reboot and wipe them.
      Be careful using buildwalk. If you mess up you will have a lot of rooms
      to delete.

DIG UNDIG RDIG RELINK RLINKS 

Builders working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   
Usage: dig <direction> <target room>
   This command creates a two-way exit from the room you're currently in to the
room specified. The direction can be any of north, east, south, west, up and 
down. If the target room does not exist it will be created. If either exit 
already exists, you will receive an error. To purge an exit use: dig <dir> -1.
Directions can be abbreviated. 

Examples: 
dig north 1202
   Will make an exit to the north from here to 1202, and an exit from 1202 south
back here.  

dig north -1
   Will remove the exit you just made.

NOTE: Dig does not autosave on exit. you must type SAVEALL. This way if you 
      mess up and want the links deleted we can just reboot and wipe them.

XEDIT XEDIT-COMMANDS 

   By Xedit I mean any form of OLC: redit, medit, oedit, zedit, sedit,

i.e. Help Xedit means: help redit, help medit, help oedit, etc.

#1
QEDIT QUESTEDITOR QUEST-EDITOR AUTOQUEST-EDITOR QEDIT-NUMBER

   Quests are created using the qedit command.  Ideally, the quests should be 
created in the same zone number as the questmaster, although some builders may 
prefer to add the quest in the zone where quest completion takes place.

Quests use vnums in exactly the same way as mobiles, object and rooms.  Each 
zone will normally have 100 vnums available (#00 to #99, where # is the zone 
number).  Usually, when creating the first quest in a zone, #00 is used, 
then #01, etc.

When you qedit <vnum> to create a new quest (or edit an existing one), you will 
see the menu in @RHELP QEDIT-MENU@n

 Q) Quit
Enter Choice:
#1
QEDIT-NAME

   This is simply the name of the quest, shown in qlist.  It should be short, 
but descriptive.
#1
QEDIT-DESCRIPTION

   This should be a short description of the quest.  It is shown to players 
when they type quest list at the questmaster, and should therefore give some 
indication of what the quest requires.
#1
QEDIT-ACCEPT

    This is the text that is sent to the player when they start the quest.  It 
should describe in detail exactly what is required to complete the quest.  The 
text is simply output on the player.s screen, so be creative here.  An example 
of an accept message text could be something like:

The questmaster rummages in a large pile of papers.
The questmaster says .Ah, here it is.
The questmaster says .Bob, the local butcher has offered this quest.
The questmaster shows you a hastily scrawled note, that reads:

I am willing to offer any plucky adventurer 10 quest points if they bring me a 
large dragon steak.  These are normally acquired from the large green dragons 
up on Wyrm Mountain.  My normal source got eaten last week, and I have a large 
order to fill.  I need these within 24 hours

Thanks, Bob the Butcher, Midgaard
The questmaster sighs.
The questmaster says .A tricky quest, but it.ll cost you 5qp to back out now.
#1
QEDIT-COMPLETION

   Just like the accept message, this is simply text that is output on the 
player.s screen when they successfully complete the quest.  Prizes (quest 
points, gold coins, experience points or an object) are automatically 
announced after this text is shown, so this text does not need to have that 
information in it.
#1
QEDIT-QUIT QEDIT-MESSAGE

   The quit message is sent to the player when they type quest leave.  Players 
can lose quest points for abandoning a quest (see .Abandoned. on the next 
page), so if they lose quest points, this text really should inform them of 
that.
#1
QEDIT-FLAGS

   These are toggles on and off in a sub-menu.  When you select option 6 from
the main menu, you will see the sub-menu:

1) REPEATABLE           
Quest flags: @cNOBITS@n
Enter quest flags, 0 to quit :

   Currently, only one flag is available, the REPEATABLE flag.  When you have 
finished turning this on or off, select .0. (zero) to return to the main menu.
#1
QEDIT-TYPE

   There are a few different quest types.  When you select option .7. from the 
main menu, you will be shown a list to choose from:

0) Object         - Player needs to find a particular object.
                  Ends: When the target object is picked up.
1) Room           - Player needs to find a particular room.
                  Ends: When the player enters the target room.
2) Find mob       - Player needs to find a particular mobile.
                  Ends: When the player enters the same room as the target mob.
3) Kill mob       - Player needs to kill a particular mobile.
                  Ends: When the target mobile dies, if the player lands the 
				  killing blow.
4) Save mob       - Player needs to protect or save a particular mobile.
                  Ends: When every mobile in the same room as the target is 
				  killed.  The target mobile should be the last mobile left 
				  in the room.
5) Return object  - Player needs to find a particular object, and return it to 
                    a particular mobile.
                  Ends: When the target object is given to the specified mob.
				  When you select this quest type, you are automatically asked 
				  for the mobile vnum to whom the object should be returned.
6) Clear room     - Player needs to kill all mobiles in a particular room.
                  Ends: When the last mobile in the target room dies.

Enter Quest type :
#1
QEDIT-MASTER

   The Quest Master is the mobile who gives out the quest.  Players need to 
find the quest master in order to join the quest.  Simply enter the mobile vnum
for the questmaster, and your quest will appear on their quest list.  Only one 
questmaster can give out each quest.
#1
QEDIT-TARGET

   The target depends on the quest type.  It is the VNUM that should be found 
by the player. The table below shows which vnum type is needed.

        @uQuest Type            Target@n
Object, Return Object        - Object VNUM
Find Mob, Kill Mob, Save Mob - Mob VNUM
Room, Clear Room             - Room VNUM
#1
QEDIT-QUANTITY

   This is the number of times the player needs to repeat the quest.  For 
example, it could be the number of items the player needs to find in a .object.
quest of the number of mobs the player should kill in a .kill mob. quest.  This
should be used with caution, however. In an object quest .picking up. the same
object 20 times will also complete the quest.
#1
QEDIT-COMPLETED QEDIT-ABANDONED

 B) Completed      : [     @c0@n]  C) Abandoned   : [     @c0@n]
   The completed field is the number of quest points awarded to the player when
they successfully complete the quest. The abandoned field is the number of 
quest points that the player loses when they abandon a quest.  Players do not 
lose quest points if a quest timer expires, so this should really be zero for 
all timed quests.
#1
QEDIT-REWARDS QEDIT-GOLD QEDIT-EXPERIENCE QEDIT-OBJECT

 G) Gold Coins     : [     @c0@n]  T) Exp Points  : [     @c0@n]  O) Object : [    @c-1@n]
   
   Gold is the number of gold coins awarded to the player when they 
successfully complete the quest.

   Exp is the number of experience points awarded to the player when they 
successfully complete the quest.
   
   Object is the object vnum of a prize object that should be awarded to the 
player when they successfully complete the quest.
#1
QEDIT-LEVELS

D) Lower Level    : [     @c0@n]  E) Upper Level : [    @c34@n] 

   Players below, and above, this level will be unable to join this quest.
#1
QEDIT-PREREQUISITE

   This is the object vnum for a prerequisite object. The prerequisite object 
should be in the player.s inventory in order for them to be able to join the 
quest.  It is not taken from the player when the quest starts.
#1
QEDIT-TIME

   This is the number of .ticks. or game hours that the player has to complete 
the quest.  If this is set, then the builder should really try to do the quest 
themselves, and time how long it takes (typing .time. before and after the 
attempt), and then giving at least one extra .tick. for players to complete it.
#1
QEDIT-NEXT

   This is the quest vnum of next quest in a chain.  When a player completes 
the current quest, the next quest will automatically be joined.  This allows 
for long quests with a number of .steps..
#1
QEDIT-PREVIOUS

   This is a quest prerequisite.  The quest vnum entered here must have been 
completed by the player in order to join this quest.
#1
QEDIT-DELETE

   As the name suggests, this will delete this quest from the MUD.  You will be
asked for confirmation, in case you accidentally hit the X key.
#1

SEDIT-MISTAKES SEDIT-ADVANCED

   The message "You cannot do that here." could be caused by the following:
Failure to set the proper room vnum in the room menu, not setting or loading
the shopkeeper and failing to purge and reset the zone. 
   Often new builders will get the message "There is nothing for sale." with
their first shop. This can be caused by two things. First, you have to give the
items you wish the mob to sell through zedit and make sure they loaded onto the
mob. Second, all objects that are for sale must have a cost. Shopkeepers can
not sell something with a cost of 0.
   Another common problem is that new builders wish a mob to sell an unlimited
number of an item. To do this the item must be added to the shops product menu.
Otherwise the number of objects the shopkeeper sells will be the number in his
inventory.
   You can not use the same shopkeeper or the same room to make multiple shops.

SEDIT-KEEPER

0) Keeper      : -1 @yNone@n
   Virtual number of the shopkeeper mobile, and its name. Shopkeepers should
be hard (if even possible) to kill. They should always be NO_SUMMON, NO_BLIND, 
NO_CHARM, NO_SLEEP. 
   Shopkeepers do not _have_ to buy anything. Or sell anything... On another
note, you can have two mobiles that look the same, but one is a shopkeeper and
the other is not. Shop keeping has some tricks to it as well. You can make the
shopkeeper wander, so players have to track it down to get the object they 
need for the quest. This can be a key he sells, where the key is disguised as 
something else like a ticket. 
   Shopkeepers could just be created so that they refuse to trade with any 
player characters.  The players will then wonder why the shopkeeper exists. 
Perhaps giving him a jewel will make him friendlier. In this way, an area can
be made infinitely more exciting by making some triggers. The possibilities
are endless.

want the shopkeeper to only be open during normal working hours you can set

SEDIT-OBJ-EXTRA OBJ-EXTRA

   OBJ-EXTRA FLAGS are formed by Boolean expressions. The following operators 
are available:       ',^ = Not *, & = And +, | = Or
 
The precedence is Parenthesis, Not, And, Or. An example:
 
WEAPON [sword & long|short | warhammer | ^golden & bow] & magic

This shop will buy the following items of type WEAPON:
1. sword long magic
2. short magic (the first & is done before the first | )
3. warhammer magic
4. ^golden bow magic
 
Note that the ^ in front of golden affects ONLY golden, and nothing else in
the listing. Basically, the above expression could be written in English as:

[(sword and long) or short or warhammer or (not golden and bow)] and magic

If you want the shop to only buy ``short magic'' only if they were also swords, you could change the expression to:

WEAPON [sword & (long|short) | warhammer | ^golden & bow] & magic
                ^-Changes--^ 
 
You can also include object extra flags. The previous example used "magic" 
as a keyword that had to be on the object. If we wanted to make it so that the
MAGIC flag had to be set on the item, we would change magic to MAGIC. Similar 
changes could be made to add other flags such as HUM or GLOW. It should be 
noted that these expressions are case sensitive and that all keywords should 
appear in lower-case, while the flag names should be in all caps.

ZEDIT-ADVANCED ADVANCED

   Let us say you want there to be a single rose loaded in a garden. But, you 
want to have a max of 50 in the mud. You would simply go to the command options 
menu and tell the zone file to load an object into the room. However, the object 
will continue to load into the room, until it is maxed. To prevent 50 roses 
from loading into the room, simply hit N for new command. It will ask you where
the command should be placed. Use the SAME number as the command which loads 
the rose. This will bump the command, which loads the rose down. Then you will
be at a command options menu. Enter R for remove an object from a room. If no 
one comes along and gets the rose, the game will remove it and load another 
one. This will prevent build up. 
   Zedit can not currently give a container to a mob and then load an object to
that container. A workaround for this is to load the object to the room before
loading the mob. Then attach a load trigger to the mob that will force it to
pick up the loaded container.
   Zedit is one of the tougher forms of OLC, and allows builders to cause 
errors. Use common sense. DO NOT equip doors with objects. DO NOT close a 
door then lock it (just setting it locked makes it closed). DO NOT equip 
objects. DO NOT put an object inside a mob. I can go on and on. But I would
hope you can see the sense in all this. If you have a question ask. The 
documentation is all here, help is available. Just ask someone. PLEASE!
   When loading mobs and objs through zedit the first loaded (zedit command 0)
will be the last listed in a room when it is looked at.

Mob loading through zedit is very limited in flexibility. Zone loading commands
are saved in order by room number and the resulting list is simply run through
line by line on zone reset. The problem with this is if you want to load 4 mobs
in separate rooms there is no way to check if the mobs exist and where they are.
This results in the common problem of having towns with all the gateguards at 
one gate. This can get complex, but say 4 guards are loading at the 4 
cardinal gates: north, east, south, and west with a maxload of 4 in world. The 
load commands are also saved in the zone file in that order. On the first 
zreset you would have 4 guards at the 4 gates loading in order N, E, S, W. Then
say a player kills the guards at the E, S, W, gates, next zreset a guard 
loads at the N, E, S gates (2 now at the N gate). The same player kills the 
guards at the E and S gates. Next zreset mobs load at the N and E gates, and so
on. There is no "good" solution to this. It is simply a tradeoff in the code 
due to the desire for simplicity. Most builders never need to worry about this.
But, if you do want more control on mob loading you can do it several ways. 
Make each mob unique, don't reuse the same mob for each gate, and load only 1 
of each. Or you can use trigedit to load the mob on zreset, checking if they 
already exist. Both can be very time consuming.

ZEDIT-CREATE ZEDIT-CREATION ZONE-CREATE ZONE-CREATION ZCREATE CREATE-ZONE

Usage: zedit new <new zone number> <bottom of zone> <top of zone>

	Only Implementors can create new zones. Zones can be any size but must
consist of consecutive vnums. tbaMUD supports 0-655 zones. That means vnums 
0 -> 65500. So to create zone 350 you would type: zedit new 350 35000 35099 
for a 100 vnum zone. Which I find the easiest to manage. But, in reality you 
can create a zone of any size you want. It is my experience that most builders
rarely finish a 50 room zone so giving them over 100 is a waste of resources. 
I force most builders to start small to prove themselves before giving them 
more. When they do build a full zone of 50+ rooms, mobs, objects, etc. 
I then give them another 100. 

Examples:
   zedit new 1 100 199 - Creates zone 1 vnums 100 to 199.
   zedit new 123 12300 12499 - Creates zone 123 vnums 12300 to 12499

Max zone number is 655. Max vnum is 65534. 65535 is reserved for corpses.

command to the top of the list.  Then follow the menu which is explained below.
 
M) Load Mobile to room
  Loads a mobile to the room.
O) Load Object to room
  Loads an object to a room. 
E) Equip mobile with object
  This command should always be dependent on the mob load command before it.
  Equipping a non-existing mob will result in an error. @RHELP DEPENDENT@n.
  You do not need to load an object before equipping it to a mob. 
G) Give an object to a mobile 
  This command should always be dependent on the mob load command before it. 
  You do not need to load an object before giving it to a mob. The giving 
  assumes you want it loaded. Giving an object to a non-existing mob will 
  result in an error.
P) Put object in another object   
  Again make sure the object exists before putting another object inside it 
  There is no limit to the number of objects you can put inside.
D) Open/Close/Lock a Door
  Set the state of a door. State being one of: 0 Open, 1 Closed, 2 Closed 
  and locked. Care should be taken to set both sides of a door correctly. 
  Closing the north exit of one room does not automatically close the south
  exit of the room on the other side of the door. When setting a door locked, 
  use option 2). This will close and lock a door. It is not necessary to close
  it with one command, then lock it with another. @RHELP REDIT-EXIT@n.
R) Remove an object from the room 
  Important for reloading containers that a player may have emptied and to load
  a single instance of an object with a maxload greater than 1. @RHELP FOUNTAIN@n, 
  @RHELP ZEDIT-ADVANCED@n. You can not remove items inside a container. You must
  remove the container and then reload the container and all items
T) Assign a trigger (Advanced builders only)
  Attach a trigger to a mob, obj, or room. Usually done through REDIT, MEDIT,
  or OEDIT.  DO NOT USE THIS OPTION WITHOUT FIRST CLEARING IT WITH A LEVEL 33

number currently existing is greater than or equal to the 'max existing' 
limit, the command is not executed.
   Zone commands are listed from 0 and on. If creating a new command always
choose 0 as its number. The only exception to this is if you are making a

ZEDIT-RESETS RESET-MODES

R) Reset Mode  : @yNormal reset.@n
   Can take one of three values:
   0) Never reset 
      The age of the zone is never updated, and it will never be reset. Thus,
      the value of the Lifespan is effectively ignored.
   1) Reset only when no players in zone
      Reset the zone only after it reaches its Lifespan and after the zone 
      becomes deserted, i.e. as soon as there are no players located within 
      the zone (checked once every minute). This can make a zone more "fair" 
      because it will keep the hard mobs from reappearing in the zone until 
      everyone leaves, but on a busy MUD it can prevent a zone from ever being
      reset since the zone may never stay empty for more than one minute. 
	  NOTE: Immortals are ignored if they have nohassle on.
   2) Normal reset (DEFAULT)
      Reset the zone as soon as it reaches its Lifespan, regardless of who or 
      what is in it. This is the most commonly used Reset Mode.

ZEDIT-LIFESPAN LIFESPAN ZEDITAGE ZEDIT-AGE TOP-OF-ZONE BOTTOM-OF-ZONE ZEDIT-TOP ZEDIT-BOTTOM ZONEAGE ZONE-AGE

L) Lifespan    : @y30 minutes@n
   The number of real-time minutes between zone resets for this zone. When the
age of the zone (measured in minutes since the last time that zone has been 
reset) reaches the zones lifespan the zone is then reset when the conditions 
of the Reset Mode are satisfied.
 
B) Bottom of zone : @y1300@n
   The lowest numbered room belonging to this zone. This defines the bottom room
of the zone - You should not change this.

T) Top of zone : @y1399@n
   The highest numbered room belonging to this zone. This defines the top room
of the zone - You should not change this.

ZEDIT-ROOM ZEDIT-NUMBER 

Room number: @c1300@n              Room zone: @c13@n
   The room number is the room you are using zedit on. It must be within your
zone. The room zone is to identify the zone. Zone numbers are the room numbers
of the zone divided by 100; for example, The Builder Academy, which consists 
of rooms 1300 through 1399, is zone 13.

#1
ZEDIT-NAME ZONE-NAME 

Z) Zone name   : @yNew Zone@n
   The zone name is a label given to the zone so that it can be identified in 
system logs. As soon as you are assigned a zone give it a name.  Zone names 
will not normally be viewable by mortals.
   Do not name zones like "Rumble's Zone" it is not a descriptive title.
Use your imagination, Give your zone a proper name.  It will help us figure 
out what it is meant to be, and it will add to the game. Add your name to the    
end of the zone name to help us identify who it belongs too. If your name is
not in your zone name or zone description room it may be deleted.

MEDIT-NUMBER

-- Mob Number:  
   This is the VNUM of the mob you are editing. This number is critical, it 
is the identity of the mobile within the game. It is the number that will
be used to reference the mobile from zone files and is the number used to
load mobiles from within the game. 

   Remember, not all mobs have to be designed to be killed, develop them into 
the plot instead. In this way, an area can be made infinitely more exciting by 
having something to do besides killing. Make some quests with triggers. Have
mobs interact with the players, respond to questions, etc.
   Try to keep mobs realistic. If a mob is not humanoid they probably do not have
money, and do not go around wearing all that much by the way of clothing. 
Instead of gold reward the player with a pelt, teeth, claws, etc. Always have
a mob carry *something*. It might be low-grade piece of food, trash, or a bad
rash. Be creative.

#1
KEYWORDS

   Keywords are what the player will use to interact with the mobs and objects.
Such as "look Rusty" and "wield bludger" If you have more than one keyword 
separate them with spaces, not commas. They should never include colorcodes or 
the words "look, look at, a, an, the, of, some, etc." Only use keywords a 
player can figure out by the s-desc, l-desc, d-desc, or extra descriptions. 
Always make them unique, there are already plenty of swords and citizens on 
most MUDs.

MEDIT-KEYWORDS MEDIT-ALIAS MEDIT-SEX MEDITNAME MOB-NAME MEDIT-ALIAS MOB-SEX 

1) Sex: @yneutral@n 
   This is pretty self-explanatory. Male, Female, or Neutral. Remember if the
mob is too small to determine its sex you should set it as neutral.  

2) Keywords: @ymob unfinished@n
   A keyword is the word you use to act on a mob. For example the keyword: "Spike 
dog black angry" would allow the following commands to work: kill Spike, look 
black, consider angry, poke dog, etc. So many people get this wrong I will 
rephrase it. It is a list of KEYWORDS which players can use to interact 
with the mobile.  @RHELP KEYWORDS@n. 

Examples: "sparkly golden dragon" "bassett hound fat"

MEDIT MOBILES MOBS MCREATE MOBCREATE CREATE-MOBILE BUILD-MOBILE MOB-CREATE MOBEDIT

   Mob is short for mobile and are what we call our monsters.

Mobile Edit

Usage: medit <mob vnum>

   This command will let you edit (online) any mobile within your designated
zone. If you specify an unused vnum, a new mob will be created with that
number.

#1
MEDIT-S-DESC S-DESC SDESC MOB-S-DESC SHORT-DESCRIPTION

3) S-Desc: @ythe unfinished mob@n
   The description of the mobile used by the MUD when the mobile takes some
action.  For example, a short description of "the building assistant" would
result in messages such as "The building assistant leaves south." and "The
building assistant hits you hard." The Short Description should never end
with a punctuation mark or be capitalized because it will be inserted into 
the middle of sentences such as those above. For short descriptions, always 
use "the" or "a" unless the mobile has a proper name. Give your mobs 
interesting names and occupations. 
   Be inventive with mobs. Most mobs have a boring short description. For 
example, "a dragon" or "a goblin". While "a fierce fire breathing dragon" 
or "an obese yellow goblin" are far more impressive. Name your mobs, or at 
least give them an occupation. Seeing the generic 'a citizen' gets boring. 
As a player, which would you like to say that you killed: 'a citizen' or 
'The Great Speaker of the Land'? Both could easily be the same mob, but 
one sounds more impressive than the other. 

#1
MEDIT-L-DESCRIPTION LDESCRIPTION L-DESCRIPTION LONG-DESCRIPTION
 
4) L-Desc:-
@yAn unfinished mob stands here.@n
   This is what you see when you look at the room with the mob in it.
Unlike the Short Description, the long description must end with proper 
punctuation, and be a complete sentence with proper grammar. Remember that 
the long description will follow the room description. For the description, 
try to tell the player what the mobile looks like, how it is acting, etc... 
Do not include items in the mobs description.
   If there is an aggressive mob in the room, do not put something to the effect
of "The Draconian King rises from his throne as you enter and strikes!" either
in the room description or the mobs long description. If the mob is really
that aggressive, the player will not have time to see it. Also, if the player is
somehow protected or invisible the mob will not attack, it will look pretty 
silly. 

#1
D-DESC MEDIT-D-DESC MEDIT-EXTRA MEDIT-DESC

5) D-Desc:-
@yIt looks unfinished.@n
   The description displayed for a mobile when a player looks at the mobile by 
typing "look <mobile>." When entering this description you will use the text 
editor. So all commands under /h are once again available to you. As always 
with the text editor use /fi to format and indent your work. Try to liven up 
your mob by writing a creative description.
   Try to tell the player what the mobile looks like, how it is acting, etc...
Be careful how you word what they are wearing. For example of what not to say:
"A huge werewolf is wielding a mace of Oblivion." Reason being, if he does not
load the mace, this would not make any sense.

MEDIT-LEVEL MOB-STANDARDS MOB-LIMITS AUTOROLL AUTOGENERATE GENERATE MEDIT-STANDARDS MOB-BALANCE

(1) Level:       [  #]
(2) Auto Set Stats (based on level)

   The level of the monster, from 1 to 34. Instead of having to manually
enter all the data below, you can simply enter the level and then select option
2 to autoroll all other fields so they will be calculated for you. This is a 
guideline for builders, not a set standard. Feel free to modify any of these 
values. Keep it reasonable. The level of the mob is used in the consider 
command, and when gaining experience. 

Here is our autoroll standard, entering mob level will calculate the following:
      GET_LEVEL(OLC_MOB(d))   = LIMIT(i, 1, 34);
      GET_BONUS(OLC_MOB(d))   = mob_lev*10;          /* hit point bonus         */
      GET_HIT(OLC_MOB(d))     = mob_lev/5;           /* number of hitpoint dice */
      GET_MANA(OLC_MOB(d))    = mob_lev/5;           /* size of hitpoint dice   */
      GET_HITROLL(OLC_MOB(d)) = mob_lev/3;           /* hitroll 0-10            */
      GET_DAMROLL(OLC_MOB(d)) = mob_lev/6;           /* damroll 0-5             */
      GET_AC(OLC_MOB(d))      = (100-(mob_lev*6));   /* AC 94 to -80            */
      GET_NDD(OLC_MOB(d))     = MAX(1, mob_lev/6);   /* number damage dice 1-5  */
      GET_SDD(OLC_MOB(d))     = MAX(2, mob_lev/6);   /* size of damage dice 2-5 */
      GET_EXP(OLC_MOB(d))     = (mob_lev*mob_lev*100);
      GET_GOLD(OLC_MOB(d))    = (mob_lev*10);

MEDIT-HITROLL MEDIT-DAMROLL MEDIT-NUMDAMDICE MEDIT-SIZEDAMDICE MEDIT-BHD

(8) DamRoll:      [    5]
   Damroll determines how much damage a mob does per hit when fighting.
   
(D) Hitroll:   [   11]
   Hitroll determines how often a mob lands a direct hit when fighting.
 
Bare Hand Damage (xdy+z): 
(6) BHD NumDice:  [    5]
(7) BHD SizeDice: [    5]
   For BHD (bare hand damage), xdy specifies the dice rolls and z is the 
strength bonus added both to BHD and weapon-inflicted damage. For example,
a monster with a BHD of 1d4+10 will do between 11 and 14 hit points each 
round without a weapon. If the monster picks up and wields a tiny stick 
which gives 1d2 damage, then the monster will do 1d2 + 10 points of damage 
per round with the stick.

(3) HP NumDice:  [    #]
(4) HP SizeDice: [    #]
(5) HP Addition: [    #]
(range # to #)      

   Hit Points are calculated by rolling dice. The first value determines
the number of die, the second the size of the die. This may be confusing 
for some so to make this easier I would suggest to always set the HP 
Bonus: to how many hit points you want the mob to have instead of having 
to figure out the rolls of the dice etc. Or better yet, just enter the mob
level and let the autoroll settings calculate it for you.

MEDIT-ARMOR-CLASS MEDIT-AC

(A) Armor Class: [#]

   Armor class is the ability of the monster to avoid damage. Range is from 
-100 to 100, with lower values indicating better armor. Roughly, the scale is:
 
AC   100    Naked person
AC     0    Very heavily armored person (full plate mail)
AC  -100    Armored Battle Tank (hopefully impossible for players)

MEDIT-EXPERIENCE MEDIT-XP MEDIT-ALIGNMENT

(B) Exp Points:  [    115600]  (E) Alignment: [ 1000]

Alignment
A number from -1000 to 1000 representing the mobs initial alignment.
 
Evil     -1000  to  -350 
Neutral  -349   to   349 
Good      350   to  1000
 
The alignment of a mobile is determined entirely by you, depending on
the type of area you are creating. The alignment can be from -1000 
(extremely evil) to +1000 (divinely good).

   Experience is simply the number of experience points the mobile is born 
with. This is not the exact number of experience points the player will get
for killing the mob. A fraction of this experience is given for damaging and 
killing a mob. This is limited by a max experience gain value and will also be
split between members if grouped. Use the autoroll option if you are unsure of
what to put here. 

See Also: MEDIT-MENU
#1
MEDIT-GOLD

(C) Gold:        [       #]

   Gold is the number of coins the mobile is born with. Do not give gold to 
animals or anything unlikely to need money. For example a pigeon should not 
be carrying 100 gold. Well, maybe it is a carrier pigeon, ;-) be reasonable.
There are other ways to reward players than with gold or experience. Try
objects and quests.

MEDIT-POSITIONS MEDIT-DEFAULT MOB-POSITIONS MOBILE-POSITIONS

I) Position  : @yStanding@n
J) Default   : @yStanding@n
   Position is the state of the mobile when it is first loaded, which should 
be one of the following numbers:
 
 0) Dead             - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 1) Mortally wounded - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 2) Incapacitated    - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 3) Stunned          - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 4) Sleeping         - The monster is sleeping.
 5) Resting          - The monster is resting.
 6) Sitting          - The monster is sitting.
 7) Fighting         - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 8) Standing         - The monster is standing (DEFAULT).
 
   Default position is the position to which monsters will return after a 
fight, which should be one of the same numbers as given above for Load 
Position. In addition, the Default Position defines when the mobs long 
description is displayed. For example if a mob is sleeping it will not show 
the l-desc, instead it will display "<<s-desc>> is <<position>>."
   Angry mobs can be simulated by loading them sitting and aggressive,
with a default position of standing.  After being attacked, they will
wander around instead of sitting back down!  Other interesting things
can be done with the position values as well...

MEDIT-ATTACKS

K) Attack    : @yhit@n
   This controls the description of violence given during battles, in 
messages such as "The builders assistant @Gbites@n you very hard." Attack 
should be one of the following numbers:
 0) hit                  6) crush          11) pierce
 1) sting                7) pound          12) blast

1) SENTINEL    Mob will not leave the room.
2) SCAVENGER   The mob should pick up valuables it finds on the ground.  More

6) STAY_ZONE   Mob will not leave its zone. All mobs should have this flag or

7) WIMPY       Mob will flee when being attacked if it has less than 20% of
               its hit points.  If the WIMPY bit is set in conjunction with
               any of the forms of the AGGRESSIVE bit, the mob will only
               attack mobs that are unconscious (sleeping or incapacitated).
8) AGGR_EVIL   Mob will attack players that are evil-aligned.
9) AGGR_GOOD   Mob will attack players that are good-aligned.
10) AGGR_NEU   Mob will attack players that are neutrally aligned.
11) MEMORY     Mob will remember players that initiate attacks on it, and will
               attack that player if it ever runs into him again.
12) HELPER     The mob will attack any player it sees in the room that is
               fighting with a mobile in the room. Useful for groups of
               mobiles that travel together; i.e. three snakes in a pit, to
               force players to fight all three simultaneously instead of
               picking off one at a time.
13) NOCHARM    Mob cannot be charmed.
14) NOSUMMON   Mob cannot be summoned.
15) NOSLEEP    Sleep spell cannot be cast on mob.
16) NOKILL     Mob cannot be attacked.

result in messages such as "The building assistant picks up a long, green 
stick." The Short Description should never end with a punctuation mark or begin
capitalized because it will be inserted into the middle of sentences. For short
descriptions, always use "the/a/an/etc." unless the item has a proper name. 

Examples:
"Excalibur" "the wooden barrel" "an emerald bracelet"

OEDIT-L-DESC

3) L-Desc   :-
@yAn unfinished object is lying here.@n
   The long description is displayed when the object is seen lying on the 
ground, for example, "A furled umbrella is lying here." Unlike the Short 
Description, the Long Description should end with appropriate punctuation 
and the first letter should be capitalized. Just like a full sentence with
proper grammar. 

Examples:
"Excalibur, the sword of all swords, lies here."
"A wooden barrel rests in the corner collecting dust."
"A fine emerald bracelet sparkles magnificently."

OEDIT-A-DESC A-DESC ADESC ACTION-DESCRIPTION OEDIT-ADESC ACTION_DESCRIPTION  

4) A-Desc   :-
@ynot set@n
   Action Descriptions are used primarily for magical objects (staves, wands, 
scrolls, and potions) to specify what message displayed to the room when the
magical item is used. If no Action Description is present, a default message 
will be used:
Staves: Rumble taps <object> three times on the ground.
Wands: Rumble points <object> at Zemial.
Scrolls: Rumble recites <object>.
Potions: Rumble quaffs <object>.

   For readable papers, the Action Description contains the text on the paper.
@RSo unless your object is a staff, wand, scroll, potion, or note; DO NOT USE.@n
   I guess this needs to be repeated once more. A-desc does not normally need 
to be set. Except for the few instances listed above. It is not the object's
equivalent of the D-desc. If you want someone to see something when they 
look at the object add it in the extra description menu with the same keywords.

A-desc is not seen by the person using the object. Only by the victim and other
players in the room. The following variables can be used with it. 
  
$e he/she/it person using staff/wand/scroll/potion 
$E he/she target of staff/wand/scroll/potion 
$m him/her person using staff/wand/scroll/potion
$M him/her target of staff/wand/scroll/potion
$n char name person using staff/wand/scroll/potion (your name)
$N char name target of staff/wand/scroll/potion (other persons name)
$s his/her/its person using staff/wand/scroll/potion
$S his/her target of staff/wand/scroll/potion

5) Type        : @cUNDEFINED@n
   This specifies what type an object is defined as and controls the meanings
of value0 through value4 (option C). The Type Flag must be one of the following:
 
0    UNDEFINED      Do not set.
1    LIGHT          Item is a light source.
2    SCROLL         Item is a magical scroll.
3    WAND           Item is a magical wand.
4    STAFF          Item is a magical staff.
5    WEAPON         Must be piercing to backstab.
6    FURNITURE      Item may be sat on.
7    FREE           Do not set.
8    TREASURE       Item is treasure other than gold coins (i.e. gems)
9    ARMOR          Item is armor. Set AC in values, @RHELP OEDIT-VALUES@n.
10   POTION         Item is a magical potion.
11   WORN           Item is worn, but not armor.
12   OTHER          Miscellaneous object with no special properties.
13   TRASH          Trash is not bought by shopkeepers.
14   FREE2          Do not set.
15   CONTAINER      Item is a container. Be creative, make robes with pockets, etc.
16   NOTE           Item is a note @RHELP OBJ-NOTE@n for more info.
17   LIQ CONTAINER  Item is a drink container. Do not include liquid type in s-desc.
18   KEY            Item is a key.
19   FOOD           Item is food.
20   MONEY          Value set in the C) Applies. Cost not used. Max 1000 coins.
21   PEN            Item is a pen.
22   BOAT           Item is a boat; allows you to traverse water (noswim).
23   FOUNTAIN       Item is a fountain. Set Values to -1 to make it unlimited.

   Good items should be very rare, and hard to get. Lousy items should require 
much less effort. Give the most powerful items actually to a mob; Thieves and
Mages can often steal stuff on the ground without even bothering with the mob. 
Useless objects that can be easily obtained (on easy mobs or just sitting in 
the room) should be truly useless! Do not leave equipment that is actually 
beneficial lying around. This may sound obvious, but it has been done. 
   Also consider creating objects that are harmful to the owner. Objects that
lower certain stats, saving throws, or confer weaknesses make the game more
interesting. Remember that a lot of small items make an area more interesting 
than a few incredibly powerful items, for the most part. Do not limit yourself
to only armor and weapons. A giant untakeable monolith, and other strange and 
odd items can add a lot of atmosphere to an area. They can also be used to 
distract players. Most of the useless items are often best as trash, but can 
be worn, and do not be afraid of using strange wear flags. After all, who is 
to say that boat you just created can not actually be a ring of water walking? 
All that would be needed for that is to have a boat with a finger wear position 
set.
   You can and should add depth and interest to your area by creating objects
that do not have any game value. These can be rocks, candlesticks, toys,
clothing, or anything else you can think of. This makes the truly useful
objects more challenging to find, and it provides good props for people who
enjoy role-playing. Useless objects are typically type trash.

OEDIT-EXTRA-FLAGS OEDIT-FLAGS OBJECT-FLAGS OBJECTFLAGS GLOW HUM NODROP NO_DROP NORENT NO_RENT OFLAGS OBJFLAGS OBJ-FLAGS 

6) Extra flags : @cNOBITS@n
 
1)   GLOW            Item is glowing (cosmetic).
2)   HUM             Item is humming (cosmetic).
3)   NORENT          Item cannot be rented.
4)   NODONATE        Item cannot be donated.
5)   NOINVIS         Item cannot be made invisible.

8)   NODROP          Item is cursed and cannot be removed or dropped.
9)   BLESS           Item is blessed (cosmetic).
10)  ANTI_GOOD       Item cannot be used by good-aligned characters.
11)  ANTI_EVIL       Item cannot be used by evil-aligned characters.
12)  ANTI_NEUTRAL    Item cannot be used by neutral align characters.
13)  ANTI_MAGIC_USER Item cannot be used by the Mage class.
14)  ANTI_CLERIC     Item cannot be used by the Cleric class.
15)  ANTI_THIEF      Item cannot be used by the Thief class.
16)  ANTI_WARRIOR    Item cannot be used by the Warrior class.
17)  NOSELL          Shopkeepers will not buy or sell the item.

   Always try to promote role-playing. The last thing you should do is have 
Thieves running around wearing dangly bracelets making noise, Clerics and Mages
wearing large suits of armor and Warriors wearing delicate clothing. None of 
that makes sense! So, use your head a little while creating equipment. If the 
equipment gives addition hitpoints then it should probably be made of metal and
should be geared for Warrior types. We do not need Mages out there with bonus 
hitpoints on all their eq. 
   Class and Race restrictions are very important. Be sure to know what your 
MUD uses for both and build for them. For example, a Minotaur would not wear 
a regular helmet on his head. Minotaurs take pride in their horns, so their
horns must be showing. Minotaurs also have hooves for feet. It would be tough 
for most to wear regular boots. Use some common sense when creating your 
equipment. Think about each object you create. Think about who you are creating
it for.

OEDIT-WEAR-FLAGS WEAR-FLAGS WIELD-FLAG WEAR-FLAG

7) Wear flags  : @cTAKE@n
 
 1) TAKE        Item can be taken (picked up off the ground) (DEFAULT).
 2) FINGER      Item can be worn on the fingers. (2 positions)        
 3) NECK        Item can be worn around the neck. (2 positions)
 4) BODY        Item can be worn on the body, (AC multiplier = 3).*
 5) HEAD        Item can be worn on the head, (AC multiplier = 2).*
 6) LEGS        Item can be worn on the legs, (AC multiplier = 2).*
 7) FEET        Item can be worn on the feet.
 8) HANDS       Item can be worn on the hands.
 9) ARMS        Item can be worn on the arms.
10) SHIELD      Item can be used as a shield.
11) ABOUT       Item can be worn about the body.
12) WAIST       Item can be worn around the waist.
13) WRIST       Item can be worn around the wrist. (2 positions)
14) WIELD       Item can be wielded; e.g. weapons.
15) HOLD        Item can be held (the "hold" command).

   Wear position of body will cause the object to actually affect the
players armor class by AC of object times 3. Head and Legs are times 2.

   If you plan to have an object that is not to be taken, you can either remove
the take flag on it, or give it a large weight (50 max). This way, players 
will not be able to take it. By giving it a large weight this causes the code 
to say it is too heavy for you instead of "You can't take that". Good for 
statues, and funny when you see players dropping all their stuff and stripping
naked to get the things. Objects without take flags do not require a weight, 
cost, cost/day, applies, min level, and perm affects.
   Note that the TAKE bit controls whether or not an item can be picked up 
using the get or take command, whereas the HOLD bit controls if the object 
can be worn using the hold command. The wear flags determine how you can 
handle the object. Default is TAKE, but to wear armor etc. you need to give 
it a wear location. Note, however, that items without the TAKE cannot be 
picked up. Objects such as fountains or statues should have the take flag 
removed. 
   Make sure every object has an extra description, and that they are balanced,
both by stats, and by wear positions. To do this I would recommend that every 
zone has at least a complete set of equipment.  This prevents the typical MUD 
where they have 200 weapons, and 10 that can be worn on the wrist.  

#1
OEDIT-WEIGHT WEIGHT

8) Weight      : @c0@n
   The weight of the object. The weight controls how many strength points a 
character must have to take the object, and is used to calculate when bags 
and other containers become full. Every takeable object should have a weight 
of at least 1. Every object that can be taken should have a weight. Weight 
max for takeable objects is 30 (ex: body armor). Weight min is 1 (ex: ring).
Everything that has a take flag must have a weight. For weapons a  weight of 
18 means only a player with strength 18 or up can wield it. 
   If you do not want something to be taken you can remove the TAKE flag.

OEDIT-VALUES OBJECT-VALUES VALUES OBJ-VALUES

C) Values      : @c0 0 0 0@n
   The meaning of an object's four values (value 0 through value 3) varies 
depending on the Type Flag of the object. A table listing these values is
included below. These values are very simple and you do not have to use the
values below to understand them. When you select C You will be sent to a 
different menu depending on the object type.   

LIGHT 
   value 0: unused
   value 1: unused
   value 2: Capacity of light in hours.
      0: Burned out light.
     -1: Eternal light source.

WAND 
   value 0: Level at which wand's spell is cast.
   value 1: Charge capacity of wand (>= 1)
   value 2: Current number of charges remaining
   value 3: Spell number @RHELP SPELLS@n 

STAFF 
   value 0: Level at which staff's spell is cast.
   value 1: Charge capacity of staff (>= 1)
   value 2: Current number of charges remaining

FURNITURE 
   value 0: Number of people that can sit on this object.

FREE - Not used. 
TREASURE - No values currently used.

ARMOR
   value 0: AC-apply of the armor.  Note that the effective change to AC is
this value times a multiplier based on where the armor is worn (Body X3,
Head and Legs X2). Positive values enhance AC; negative values hurt AC
(cursed armor for example).
   armor should be consistent with its description, meaning an item such as a
cloth shirt is not expected to be good armor, therefore it should not be.
Similarly, a tempered meteoric steel breastplate sounds rather impressive and
should be.

POTION 
value 0: Level at which the potion's spells are cast.
value 1: Spell number 1
value 2: Spell number 2    @RHELP SPELLS@n 
value 3: Spell number 3

B) Extra descriptions menu
   Extra descriptions are used to make a room/obj more interesting, and make them
more interactive. Extra descriptions are accessed by players when they type
"look <<thing>>," where <thing> is any word you choose.  For example, you might
write a room description, which includes the tantalizing sentence, "The wall
looks strange here." Using extra descriptions, players could then see
additional detail by typing "look wall."  Choosing this option will bring you 
to the extra descriptions menu: 

1) Keyword: @y<NONE>@n
   List the words you want people to use to interact with it. Simply the 
<thing>. Do not use a/an/the/look/read in this field.

2) Description:
@y<NONE>@n
   This is the text editor for describing something in the room. Be sure to
use /fi by typing it into the last line and hitting enter.

3) Goto next description: <NOT SET>
   This option will allow you to make as many extra descriptions as you want.

   To delete an extra description all you have to do is clear the description 
with the "/c" then "/s" and quit.

the opposite direction in the destination room. Thanks to our coders you will
not normally modify exits this way, instead you would use dig or buildwalk.
@RHELP DIG @n|@R HELP BUILDWALK@n. Both are excellent time-savers.

2) Description :-
@yNONE@n
What people see when they look in that direction. i. e. look north.
These must always be complete sentences. For example, "You see the
main chamber of the temple." These can really flesh out a zone.

3) Door name   : @yNONE@n
This is a keyword field. A keyword is the word you use when you perform
an action. Such as opening and closing. It can be more than one word, but
the first word is the only one displayed in the output messages. i.e. Rumble
opens a <Door name>.

4) Key         : @c0@n
If you wish the door to be locked then you must first make an object of
type key. That object VNUM is then placed in this field. @RHELP KEY-BASICS@n.

5) Door flags  : @cNo door@n
Choosing this option will display a third menu to select the door type.
0) No door          -- Default setting
1) Closeable door   -- Door can be opened/closed/locked (pickable)
2) Pickproof        -- Door can only be opened with key (sorry thieves) 

6) Purge exit.
This last option is available to set this exit to default.
This will clear all values and set the Exit to : -1 (nowhere).

Instead of having to link rooms manually through olc we have implemented
Buildwalk and the dig command. See the help files on each for more 
information once you have finished your trialroom and have a zone. 

   Remember that for working two-way doors, the rooms on each side must have
matching door flags, doors, and zone commands to close them.

KEY-BASICS KEYS-BASICS OEDIT-KEYS

If you want to make a room accessible only by a key you must first make an 
object of type key and then place that objects vnum in the exit menu. To
prevent a thief from picking the lock you must also set the PICKPROOF flag.

Always create a unique name and description for your key and give hints in the 
description about where it should be used.

PRIVATE SOUNDPROOF HCRSH ATRIUM REDIT-FLAGS NO-MOBS

Usage: showvnums

   Toggles a flag which causes the virtual numbers for all room/mob/obj flags 
to be displayed. Also now shows if a trigger is attached.

3) Room flags  : @cNOBITS@n
The following room flags can be selected:

1)  DARK       - The room is dark, players need a light source, or infravision.
2)  DEATH      - Players die on entry. All dropped items will be junked.
3)  NO_MOB     - Mobs will not enter this room. This can be used to define the
                 zone where any mob can wander. For example, lower level mobs 
                 can be set so that only they can wander on the first level of 
                 a dungeon by making the stairwells NO_MOB. A NO_MOB room will 
                 not prevent pets and charmed mobs from following players. A
                 mob can flee into a NO_MOB room.
4)  INDOORS    - Weather messages will not be sent to room, always lighted. 
                 Call lightning will not work.
5)  PEACEFUL   - No violence will work here. Use sparingly.
6)  SOUNDPROOF - Tell, gossip, shout, holler will not be heard here. This flag
                 should be used sparingly also, it is very annoying IMHO.
7)  NO_TRACK   - Track will never find a path through this room.
8)  NO_MAGIC   - No magic will work here. 
9)  TUNNEL     - Only one person allowed at one time.
10) PRIVATE    - Only room for 2 players/mobs i.e. a tunnel or small space.
11) GODROOM    - Only allows GODS of level 33 or above to goto.
12) HOUSE      - DO NOT USE. Room is a house.       \  automatically
13) HCRSH      - DO NOT USE. House needs saving.     >    set by 
14) ATRIUM     - DO NOT USE. The door to a house.   /    hcontrol
15) OLC        - DO NOT USE. Is room modifiable.
16) *          - DO NOT USE. Breadth-first search mark used by track and hunt.
17) WORLDMAP   - DO NOT USE. World Map style maps.

Never set UNUSED or DO NOT USE bits, if you find them anywhere. If you 
do not know what a flag does, DO NOT SET IT!

This requires repeating since it is so often ignored:
   @YIf a flag says UNUSED; DO NOT SET IT. If you do not know what it does; DO NOT SET IT!@n

BULLETINS BOARDS BULLETIN-BOARDS MESSAGE-BOARDS POSTING

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '/s' as the first characters on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Examples:
  > look at board
  > write Crash Bug I found!
  [writes the message; terminates with '/s']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

Boards are just a normal object with a special procedure attached in the
MUD's code. Ask your friendly implementor if you need to make one.

@uRoom - Board@n 
1204 - Immortal Board
1290 - Social Board

   This line is solely for informational purposes, you edit nothing here. It
lists the VNUM of the room (1399) and the zone number (13). Notice zone number
and VNUM have the same first few numbers.

REDIT-NAME ROOM-NAME ROOM-TITLE REDIT-TITLE

1) Name        : @yAn unfinished room@n
   This line can be edited in redit by typing 1 and hitting return. You may 
then enter the name of the room. The room name is displayed before the room 
description when players look at the room. Room name should be formatted like 
a title of a book. First letter always capitalized. Do not use punctuation in 
the room title. Room title is not a complete sentence but all words except 
prepositions should have their first letter capitalized. For example, "The Clan 
Ranks of the Builder Academy" Think of it as the shortest possible description 
of this room. It should not contain any ending punctuation like a period.

Examples: 
"An Empty Dark Tunnel", "The Elcardorian Bakery", "Ms. Celande's Office"
"The Beginning of the End" "Two Paths Diverge in the Woods" "Jack's Trial Vnum"

See also: DESCRIBING, REDIT-EXTRA-DESC, OEDIT-EXTRA-DESC, EXTRA

#1
REDIT-EXTRA-DESC REDIT-EXTRAS EXTRAS 

B) Extra descriptions menu 
   When choosing this option you will be sent to the menu explained under
@RHELP EXTRA@n. This menu is used for both rooms and objects.
   If you have a lot to say try to use extended descriptions and/or objects
to increase the amount of description in the room without bloating the room 
description too much. For doors, exits, and so forth, try to include an extra
description of the door (for example, one for "door wooden"). For extra 
descriptions, try to make one for each thing that you think a player would look 
at in the room description or in other extra descriptions. If there is one 
word that could mean two or more things, include them all if you like, or 
direct the player to another description for such.
Any noun in the room description that cannot be adequately described, but 
is hinted to play some sort of role should either outright exist as an object
or have an extra description in the room representing it.  This goes even if 
the idea of the object being of use is a mere smokescreen. Use extra 
descriptions extensively, to flesh out a room, exits, and objects. Hide info,
hints, tips and tricks in them.  
   Of course all rooms have a description. But very few ever have extra 
descriptions. For example, there might be something mentioned in the room 
description but when you type "look <<at what was described>>" it says "You do
not see that here."  If you mention a painting then a player who takes the
time to type look painting should see something, it does not have to be 
anything spectacular, just a simple painting of a lake and open field etc.
This is a very important part of building. How would you otherwise convey 
the feeling you have about an area, if you do not put it in writing. People
cannot read your mind. In the interest of yourselves, the players who are 
going to play your area (and to make the staff here proud :P), use those extra
descriptions.

#1
OEDIT-EXTRA-DESCRIPTIONS OEDIT-EXTRAS

E) Extra descriptions menu
   When choosing this option you will be sent to the menu explained under
@RHELP EXTRA@n. This menu is used for both rooms and objects.
   Object Extra Descriptions allow players to examine certain aspects of 
objects defined by the builder, just like Room Extra Descriptions. There can 
be an unlimited number of Extra Descriptions per object.
   Take your time on making your objects and use extra descriptions, please!
For objects, be very liberal in how you describe them. Remember that a 
player's mental view on an object is based solely on what you tell them 
about it. There is nothing worse than looking at an object and seeing "The 
sword is big." Yes, this tells the player that it is a sword and it is big, 
but what else? What color? Is it sharp, notched, dull...? Make your objects 
interesting. Make your objects personal to the mob that carries them. If you 
make a cloak that loads on the wizard Throm, make it "The Magic Cloak of 
Throm" or even just "the wizard's cloak". Anything but just a plain old cloak.
Which would you rather have, as a player? When making extra descriptions ensure
that all the keywords are covered by the description. Extra descriptions can 
add small interesting details to your area and are often remembered by players.
Please take the time to write extra descriptions. On most MUDs, you can look
at 100 objects and "You see nothing special..." all 100 times. In an effort to 
make all MUDs different and better, take the time to write an extra description
for your object. Think of an object's extra description as the same thing as a
mob's description when you look at it, which it actually is. For the extra
descriptions keywords, use the same keywords as you did earlier. 
A very easy way to detect lazy builders with bad grammar is when objects
have no description at all. This causes frustration on the player side, because
when you have seen "You see nothing special..." once too many, you just do not
try to look at items anymore. 
   One of the most difficult things you will come across when creating an
object is giving it a good description. We all like descriptions, so take a 
little time to put your signature on the objects you create. Objects can give
the total sense of being within a certain world. They can also give clues as 
to what may lie ahead or what has happened in the past.

REDIT-DESCRIPTIONS ROOM-DESCRIPTIONS ROOMDESCRIPTIONS

2) Description :
@yYou are in an unfinished room.@n
   The description of the room is seen when players type "look," and when they 
enter. Select 2 to enter the room description while in redit. When you enter 
the room description for the first time make sure to type /c and hit enter to 
clear the current contents (You are in an unfinished room.) You edit the 
room description in what is called the text editor. @RHELP TEXT-EDITOR@n. 
Learn all of the text editor commands, they will be very useful.
   Do not clone rooms without a specific reason. Saving time or energy is not 
an excuse. Players who play in zones with multiple copies of a description stop 
reading the descriptions. The zone becomes monotonous, and hence the MUD does. 
If the MUD is boring, why play it? Why even build it? Changing a description by 
one or two words counts as copying as well. Always keep in mind that the game 
is meant to be fun, so frustration, boredom, and irritation when reading 
something must be avoided at all costs. There are very few exceptions to this 
rule, and believe it or not, building a maze is -not- one of them.
   In the room description itself, you should include the important things in
the room.  The next thing to consider is all of the long extra descriptions of 
things you are going to enter. You were going to enter nice long text 
descriptions of things, right? This is the new millennium and you are the 
culmination of centuries of evolution/creation and we cannot have zones like 
the Sewers where half the rooms are: "This is a long, boring tunnel. This is 
another long, muddy, boring tunnel."
   Some players are evil, some are good, and many are not even human. When 
writing descriptions be sure not to assume the nature of the character reading
it. For example, do not say "The warrior towers above everyone in the room" when
the character looking at him might be a giant. Some players may be flying,
some may be near death, some may be high level and fearless in your zone, others
low level and easily killed. Do not assume fear, thirst, anxiety, etc.
Remember mobs can be killed, move, or not load. Objects can be taken or not 
load, so never include them in the room descriptions.
Room descriptions must be at least 3 lines and no more than 13 lines (if 
you run out of space use extra descriptions). Rooms with less than three lines
are almost not worth creating in the first place, and more than 13 lines makes 
life difficult for the reader, especially when just passing through.
   If you feel you need a really long road, say the road is really long. A few 
rooms straight of a road or hallway or what not is pretty long. Do not feel the 
need to extend it. Always include at least one interesting thing per three or
so rooms. For example, have a bench in the garden or a table loaded to the 
room. These objects do not have to do anything, just break up the sparse rooms.
If you are pressured to write bigger descs or make more rooms, relax. The best 
zones are usually very small and their size should not be measured by how many
times someone has to enter w to go down the road, you can say something is any
size you feel like making it with words alone.

SAVEALL AUTOSAVE SAVE-ALL REDIT-SAVE ZSAVE

   All OLC on TBA is saved automatically on exit with the exception of
buildwalk, dig, and room/mob/obj delete. These are left unsaved in case a new 
builder inadvertently buildwalks, digs, or deletes where they did not want to. 
Unsaved OLC is lost after a shutdown reboot. But, it is autosaved with a 
copyover or shutdown die. All other forms of OLC are saved by quitting and 
saying "yes" to save internally.

     3)    CLOSED         Container is closed when created.
     4)    LOCKED         Container is locked when created.
   value 2: The vnum of the key object that opens this container.
     -1 if it has no key.
   value 3: Reserved for internal use -- always set as 0.

Container capacity counts towards the total container weight.

AC-CONFIDENCE ARMOR-CLASS ARMOUR-CLASS AC-APPLY 

   Your Armor Class (often called AC) is an expression for how good your armor
is at protecting you.  When you don armor, any AC apply that armor has is 
subtracted from your standard (naked) AC value, modified depending on where on
the body you are wearing the armor.  Some items have a special bonus, and 
subtract from the AC directly. Negative AC is better. Modifiers: Body X3, 
head and legs X2.

PETITION

The petition command allows you to seek the assistance from any available
staff member online.  The syntax is as follows:  petition <question to ask>.

You may only petition once every 5 minutes to prevent insistent players from
spamming our staff with petitions.

You are not to use the petition system to report bugs, typos or to make
suggestions or simply because you want to chat.  If you are looking for
a specific staff member for some reason, please use the mail command
instead of the petition command.  They will receive a notification as
soon as the mail is sent if they are online, and if not, they will
receive it as soon as they log on.

If you do have a bug or typo to report, or you want to make a suggestion,
please do so on our forums at http://www.ageofdragons.com/

Before submitting a petition you must first do everything possible to
solve your problem on your own.  That includes using help files (if
there is one and it is up-to-date), checking the online forums, and
asking other players using the newbie and chat commands.  If, and only
if, your situation cannot be resolved using those methods, then you
may submit a petition.

In the case of problems with another player, such as harrassment, cheating,
or some other serious problem, in this case do not seek help from other
players, but instead submit a petition right away, even if you or others
think the matter to be trivial.  We take harrassment, bullying, cheating,
and other out-of-character mistreatment very seriously here, as we pride
ourselves on having a friendly, positive, drama-free atmosphere on our
MUD.

If you do not get a response from petition our GMs, please send a mail
using the mail command to the staff member in charge of the area you
are having an issue with.  These people are as follows:
Dran: All mob, object, room or zone issues.  Bugs should be posted on the forum.
      However, at times you may need special attention, such as when your
      character stats are messed up or something.  In this case please
      contact Dran if your petition is unanswered.

CHALLENGE FEAT-COMBAT-CHALLENGE FEAT-IMPROVED-COMBAT-CHALLENGE FEAT-GREATE

The combat challenge series of feats is used for tanking mobs.  It is done
through the @Ychallenge@n command, and will cause any targeted mobs who are
not currently fighting someone else who is not partied with you, to attack you.

You may either specify a specific mob to challenge, or you may specify 'all'
and have all mobs in the room who are not otherwise occupied attack you.
The 'all' effect requires the improved version of this feat.

These actions use up combat actions to perform.  See the following table:

Highest Feat Possessed | One Mob       | All Mobs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Combat Challenge       | Stanard       | Impossible
Improved               | Move          | Standard
Greater                | Minor         | Move
Epic                   | Minor         | Minor

Each feat has a prerequisite.  See the following table:

HOW-TO-PLAY

A MUD is a text game and is run through typing commands into your input bar (if
you're using a MUD client that is.  If you don't have one consider using
MUSHClient: http://www.gammon.com.au/mushclient/mushclient.htm).  Everything
that is done on this game is done by typing in a text command, and every output
is also received in text displayed to your screen.

So playing this game comes down to typing commands and responding to output
from the game.

Some of the important commands you will need right away are:
who - displays a list of who is online (if you haven't met the person it 
    might display a description instead of a name)
say - allows you to speak with people in the same room
chat (d20 only) - allows you to speak with everyone on the game
rsay (d20 only) - allows you to speak with other people in the room 'in character'
    (role playing). Awards experience and rp points.
tell - allows you to send a private message to another person in the game
north/east/south/west/ne/se/sw/ne/up/down - allows you to move from one room to the 
    next.
look - allows you to see what is in the room, or if targetting on a mob, player or 
    object, will display information about that entity
score - allows you to see basic information about your own character
hit/attack - allows you to attack monsters or players
cast - allows you to cast spells if you are a spellcaster (type help cast if you are 
    on d20 mud as there are different cast commands for each class)
memorize - allows you to memorize spells if you are a spellcaster class (on d20 
    version you should type help memorize)
help - displays a menu with information about how to play the game
help - displays information about the topic specified (help newbie is a good place 
    to start)
flee - allows you to escape combat if things go poorly
recall (d20 only) allows you to go back to the start room if you get lost

CRAFTING CUSTOM-CRAFTING

The crafting system on d20MUD is designed to allow people to both supplement
their own equipment as an adventurer, or to simply be a full time crafter and
provide crafted goods to other classes in exchange for coin or other items.

The crafting system is comprised of multiple parts:
1. Harvesting materials to use in creation of the item
2. Finding magical essences to imbue the item with magic
3. Finding crystals to direct the power of the magical essence into a specific bonus.
4. Buying a mold to use as the basis for the item desired to be created.

Please read the following help files to learn more about those items:
@YESSENCES@n, @YCRYSTALS@n, @YMOLDS@n, @YMATERIALS@n, @YHARVESTING@n

Once you have collected everything that you need to create the item, find yourself
a crafting station (In Palanthas, they are located in the basement of the Inn of
the Platinum Dragon, just east of the center square), and put all of your materials,
the mold, the crystal, and making sure to put the essence as the last item, all into
the station with the @Yput@n command.

Once you have all of the materials in the station, you need to use the @Ycreate@n
command to create your item.  There are a number of pre-requisites that need to
be met in order to create the item, but the basic syntax of the command is,
'create <description of the item to be created>'

The description can be anything you want, but it MUST be role play oriented, and
it must coincide with a medieval theme.  If it does not, the item may be taken from
you without reimbursement.  The description must also contain the name of the item
type, determined by the mould (some item types have multiple possibilities) and the
name of the material being used.  You may use color in your description as well if
you like, though please be tasteful.

Once you type the create command, if all of the requisites are met, the crafting
process will begin, and a certain amount of time later, depending on the type of
item being created, you will be rewarded with the item you wanted to make and
a certain amount of artisan experience as well.

ESSENCES MAGICAL-ESSENCES CRAFTING-ESSENCES DIVIDE

Magical essences are small globes of glass or crystal filled with the very
essence of magic itself.  They are created by a powerful ritual meant to harness
the surrounding magical energy, or simply by extracting magical power from an
existing magical item.

Magical essences come in a number of varieties, but the most common is the power
essence.  This type of essence is used to fuel crafters in their desire to create
magical items.

A power essence can be of minor, lesser, medium, greater or major power.  The
higher up in that list, the greater the magical bonus will be on the item,
determined by the crystal used in the crafting process.

Essences of the same type and power grade can be combined in the crafting process
to increase the base bonus.  For every 4 essences of the same type and power grade
put into a crafting station, the base bonus of the essence will be increased by
1x.  So 4 minor essences used on a damage crystal, will result in +2 damage instead
of +1.  8 will be +3 instead of +1.  Used with a max hit point crystal, it will
be +10 to max hp instead of +5 for 4 essences, or +15 for 8 essences.  Please note
that the max bonus of the item, is still capped by the level of the crystal.  This
means that if the bonus determined by the essences creates an item with a minimum
usable level greater than the level of the crystal, the bonus will be shifted down
until it is within the level of the crystal, or the minimum bonus amount for that
bonus type, whichever is greater.

Major, greater, medium, and lesser essence can be divided into multiple minor
essences by using the @Ydivide@n command on them.
Dividing a major essence produces 5 minors.
Dividing a greater essence produces 4 minors.
Dividing a medium essence produces 3 minors.
Dividing a lesser essence produces 2 minors.

CRYSTALS MAGICAL-CRYSTALS CRAFTING-CRYSTALS

Crystals are pieces of glass, crystal or gemstone that have been infused with alchemical
properties, which can be used in combination with magical essences to provide a certain
type of bonus to crafted equipment.

Each crystal has both an apply type and a level.  The level is the maximum level that
the item being created can be, and the apply type is the type of bonus that will be
applied to the item being crafted.  Please note that only one crystal may be used
per crafting session, and any additional ones added will be wasted.

If the bonus provided by magical essences is higher than the level of the crystal,
the item will be downgraded until it is within the level of the crystal, or until
it has the minimum bonus amount for that type, whichever is greater.

Harvested gem stones can be synthesized into crystals to be used for crafting
with the @Ysynthesize@n command and the alchemy skill.

MOLDS CRAFTING-MOLDS

Crafting molds are really just existing, mundane items, that have been made
to specification by authoritative crafters.  They can most often be found
as the stock items sold in the marketplaces of various cities around the world.

The crafting mold determines the type of item that will be created in the
crafting process, as well as how many materials are needed.

MATERIALS CRAFTING-MATERIALS

Crafting materials are harvested natural resources that can be used in the
creation of custom equipment through the crafting system.

Every different type of item will require a different kind of material, with
most items having several options as to what you can use, as well as different
amounts of materials depending on how large and dense the item is.

The various kinds of materials are:

Hard Metals: Steel/Iron, Cold Iron, Mithril, Adamantine
Soft Metals: Copper, Silver, Gold, Platinum
Leather: Low Quality Hides, Medium Quality Hides, High Quality Hides, Dragonhide
Wood: Alderwood, Yew, Oak, Darkwood
Cloths: Hemp, Wool, Cotton, Velvet, Satin, Silk
Gemstones: Obisidian, Onyx, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond

The better the material is (the further to the right in the lists above), the more
artisan experience it will award for a successful harvest or crafting session.

GEMSTONES

Gemstones have been known to be succeptable to alchemical practices, and through
the @Ysynthesize@n command can be turned into crystals used in the crafting process.

The different types of gemstones are:

Obisidian, Onyx, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Diamond

They can be found by using the @Ymine@n command in hills, mountains or caves, and
success and degree of success is based on the mining skill.

See Also: @YSYNTHESIZE@n, @YCRYSTALS@n, @YCRAFTING@n, @YHARVESTING@n

#0
DISENCHANTING

The disenchanting process allows an alchemist to use various processes to extract
the magical power from an existing magical item and store it in a magical essence.

The ability is based on the artisan's alchemy skill, for which higher skills allow
for the disenchanting of more powerful items.

The process is done by using the @Ydisenchant@n command.

See Also: @YESSENCES@n
#0
HARVESTING

Harvesting is the process of going out into the wilds and using your various
skills to extract natural resources from your environment.

Harvesting is broken up into four main types:

@Ymine@n   - Mining    : hard and soft metals and gemstones (hills, mountains or caves)
@Yfarm@n   - Farming   : cloths and food ingredients (fields)
@Yhunt@n   - Hunting   : leathers and food ingredients (fields, hills, mountains, forests)
@Yforest@n - Foresting : wood (forests)

Using one of the harvesting commands above will give you a chance to find a random
material of the type associated with the type of place you are in.  The greater your
skill in that area of harvesting, the better the chance of both finding something, and
finding something good.

@YNOTE@n: The new command for all harvesting node types is '@Yharvest@n'.

FEAT FEATS

In the d20 System, a feat is one type of ability a character may gain through level
progression. Feats are different from skills in that characters can vary in competency
with skills, while feats typically provide set bonuses to or new ways to use existing
abilities. Many feats have prerequisite levels, base attack bonuses, or other skills, 
feats or abilities which must be obtained before they can be acquired.

You may gain help on a specific feat by typing help feat <name>.

You can list your feats that you know by typing @Yfeats@n.

You can list the feats that are available to you to choose by typing @Yfeats available@n.
You can list feat descriptions by typing @Yfeats available descs@n or feat prerequisites
by typing @Yfeats avail requisistes@n and finally you can list any classfeats
of your currently active class by typing @Yfeats available classfeats@n.

You can list all feats in the game by typing @Yfeats complete@n.
@n
For more info on a specific feat, type @Yhelp feat <feat name>@n.
For example, @Yhelp feat track@n.

Feats are learned during the levelling process by using the @Ylevelup@n command
when you have enough experience to gain a new level.

Everyone gains 1 feat at level 1, plus 1 feat for every level they gain that
is odd in number.  Some classes gain additional class feats selectable from a
specific list at various level intervals as well.

SKILL-BLUFF TAUNT FEINT

Bluff (Cha)
Check

Bluff can be used in role play situations to try and convince someone of 
something.  It is opposed by a character's lore skill.

You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check 
gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while 
people are aware of you.

Combat

In combat, you can use the @Yfeint@n and @Ytaunt@n commands to lower your
opponent's AC. These tactics both use your bluff skill and the effects
stack with each other (but note that repeated attempts do not stack).
Feinting is a standard action and taunting is a minor action.  If
successful, the effects last for 1+CHA modifier rounds.
Feinting removes your opponent's DEX bonus to AC, while taunting
removes 2 deflection bonus from your opponent.

Special

A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a 
favored enemy.

If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.
Synergy

If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, 
Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made 
when you know you're being observed and you try to act in character.

SKILL-BALANCE

Balance (Dex)

Check:

Balance allows you to stay on your feet in precarious circumstances,
whether someone is trying to knock you down, or if you are walking
along a precarious ledge or cliff.

Action:

None. A Balance check doesn.t require an action; it is made as part 
of another action or as a reaction to a situation.

Special:

If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.

Synergy:

If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance 
checks. 
#0
SKILL-APPRAISE

Appraise (Int)

Check:

You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12
Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value 
at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value.

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check 
against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you 
estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate 
the item.s value.

Try Again:

Yes, you can try again on the same object as many times as you like.

Special:

A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related 
to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable 
items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).

The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.

A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks.

Synergy:

If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise 
checks related to items made with that Craft skill.

Untrained:

For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For 
rare items, success means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).

CONSIDER AUTOCON

Before you attack anything you haven't fought before, you will want to
consider it.  For your convenience we have added an autocon system as well.
To manually consider your enemy type @Yconsider <target>@n.  It will give you
a message detailing how powerful the creature is compared to you.  The autocon
system on the other hand, which is turned on by default, places a symbol in
parenthesis beside the mob's long description.  It will also display a
color code.  Here is a quick legend:

@B(+)@n 8 levels lower than yours or more
@b(+)@n 7 levels lower than yours
@C(-)@n 6 levels lower than yours
@c(-)@n 5 levels lower than yours
@G(-)@n 4 levels lower than yours

GROUP

Usage: group [player]
       group all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"
  Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

of whether you typed a command or not.

HOUSE

The HOUSE command is used to add or remove guests from your house's guest
list.  You must be standing in your house to use this command.  Only the
primary owner of a house (not guests) may change the guest list using the
HOUSE command.

Usage: house [<player name>]

Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on
your house's guest list.  Typing 'house' with the name of a player will add
that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, or will
remove the player from the guest list if the player is already on the list.
The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD, although
he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.

PVP MURDER

Player vs player combat is available on an opt-in basis, and there are rules
in place to help keep it fair and enjoyable.  By default, a character is
protected from pvp combat and can neither attack nor be attacked.
Players can toggle their participation in pvp combat using the @Ypvp@n command.
Any character who has chosen to enable pvp will have a (@GPvP@n) flag shown
beside their name in the WHO list.  This flag will also appear beside their
description.  You can only initiate pvp combat against a player of
greater or equal level to your own (or to your mentor level if you have
mentor enabled).  Combat is initiated by typing @Ymurder@n <victim>.
This begins a 30-minute timer for both players during which period neither
player can disable their pvp flag.  So beware that when you engage in
pvp combat, you open yourself to further attacks and/or retaliation.
Note also that experience is neither gained nor lost by either party
regardless of the outcome.

Please remember to adhere to mud policies when engaging in pvp combat.
The pvp system is for role playing purposes - this is not a pk mud.
Harassment or abuse of the pvp system will result in revokation of a
player's pvp ability.

NOSUMMON

Usage: nosummon

Due to problems we've had with players killing other players by summoning
them to Bad Places, all characters now have SUMMON PROTECTION turned on by
default.  This prevents people from summoning you and gives you a warning
message if someone tries.  If you want to let someone summon you (i.e. if
someone wants to summon you for a legitimate reason), type NOSUMMON to turn
off summon protection.  You can then type NOSUMMON again to turn protection
back on.

instead of trying to bring them to the attention of online staff.  We won't
remember what you tell us a week later, so if you don't write it down for us,
we probably won't get it done until we realize it ourselves at some point down
the road.

SAVE

Usage: save

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

STEAL

Thief Only.

Usage: steal <item> <victim>

players.  Doing so will get you a flag for your trouble.

Examples:

  > steal gold drunk
  > steal sword mercenary
    (If it's wielded, only possible if he is sleeping)

TIME

Usage: time

particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.

Very Soft Ground

Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.

Soft Ground

Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a
creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints. 

Firm Ground

Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or
dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces
(broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.

Hard Ground

Any surface that doesnt hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most
streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away.
The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).

Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on Table: Track DC Modifiers.
If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of 
searching.

Without this feat, you can use the Survival skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if
the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Search skill to find a footprint 
or similar sign of a creatures passage using the DCs given above, but you cant use Search to 
follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them. 

Special

A ranger automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He need not select it. 
This feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a pass without trace
skill/spell. 

Usage: track <victim>

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Usage: use <staff>

yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use!  (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

AREAS

Here on Age of Dragons MUD, we do not provide a list of every area, where it is,
and what level it is, because we want to encourage people to explore.  However we
have, and still are making an attempt to gear the zones in certain areas of the game
towards various level ranges, and that information we are willing to disclose.

If you are a newbie in Palanthas, then the first zones you want to work on are the
gardens of the blue phoenix (from centre square fountain 5e n u) and the training pits
(from centre square fountain 5e s d).  Doing the quest series started by the mysterious
old woman will introduce you to other low level zones, and the area around Palanthas is
almost 100% free of aggresive enemies, so exploring is pretty safe.

If you are not a newbie, then you have to explore to find zones your level.

We are currently in the process of re-levelling zones to fit a certain level niche.  This
process is underway, but incomplete, so the following guides are not perfect.  However they
should give you an idea of where to get started.

Palanthas City and Immediate Area                   : Lvls 1-15
Greater Solamnia                                    : Lvls 15-25
Solace and the Rest of Abanasinia (incl. Qualinost) : Lvls 10-30
Tarsis, Plains of Dust and Southeastern Ansalon     : Lvls 25-50
Sanction, Blode and Neraka Areas                    : Lvls 1-30

BACKGROUND
First, let me start by welcoming you to the Eternal Empire of Toran. The
Empire is based, originally,  upon TSR's Forgotten Realms. Some things
you will find familiar, others you will not. Much has changed, and
continues to change as we move away from the Forgotten Realms.

Midway through the Year of the Wave (125) there was a dramatic shift in
the power of Clerics within the Empire. No longer would the prayers of the
faithful be answered by their deities. Only Ao, the High God, would answer the
prayers of those that converted. The Old Gods were swept away, as were
many of their most powerful followers, slaughtered by Ao's Warhost. It was
during this time, and the hard times to come, that many, especially the evil,
turned toward history for an alternative to Ao's Word. History did indeed
contain the answer they sought. Near the beginning of recorded time in Toran,
there were but two Gods. Ao, the High God, and Marduk Kurios, the Black.

The followers of Marduk gained their magical powers by tattooing their
bodies with magical sigla, and through dark rituals that often required blood
and sacrifice. For many years the two Gods struggled for control. Finally,
Kthanar the Champion of Ao recovered a magical artifact that could banish
Marduk. A mighty war hammer known as the Word of Ao. Using this war hammer,
Kthanar banished Marduk Kurios into the unknown blackness of space and time.

In the years that followed the Wave, people once again began to invoke
Marduk for His power. And He returned, their invocations had lead Him home.
Again He granted His gifts to those that would obey His Word. Now, in the
Year of Naga (148), Marduk Kurios has gained a firm hold in the Empire once
again as the faithful of Ao rush to do battle with the followers of Marduk.
Due to the nature of Tsalari magic, and the lack of understanding of magic by
the general population, normal wizards came under suspicion for a time. Some
where even burned at the stake by a panicked society.  Even the noble Jlker
Wizards who serve the Empire of Toran were held in suspicion for a time.
It was announced at this time by King Chelnar the IV that all Jlker took a
magical oath of binding that prevented them from acting 'against the
good of the Empire.' This seemed to ease the fear slightly. However, years
passed and people begun to understand the difference in Tsalari and
traditional magic better.

King Chelnar the IV ruled the Empire fair and justly, aided by the
Senate. Tension with the neighboring Empire of Nelva was mostly lower and
things seemed to be improving in just about every respect. This is always
a very good time for something very tragic to happen, and it did. King Chelnar
the IV was assassinated in his own palace during peace talks with the Empire
of Nelva. High Senator Naga, fearing this to be a prelude to a Nelven invasion
seized control of the palace and ordered it sealed. He also ordered all the
Nelven delegates put to death. When the identity of the assassin was
revealed, it was quite a shock. It was the same assassin who had killed
Chelnar's father Dhalmass, but that assassin was caught fleeing the palace
and killed in a skirmish with 7 rather upset Royal Guards. Someone had raised
the assassin from the grave to perform his deed. Naga, upon realizing his
mistake, sent word to the Nelven Emperor and his apologies. The Nelven
Emperor was said of have responded that "He understood the situation, and
would have done the same in Naga's place." The assassin escaped clean anyway
and is still at large, wanted by Naga and the Purple Dragon Soldiers for
his crimes.

As no immediate heir could be located, it was announced by the Senate
that Naga would continue to rule with support from the Senate until they
could track down an heir. None was ever found. They had all recently had
'accidents' or been killed in apparently 'random' fashion. The Senate had no
choice to announce that Naga would be the next in line of rulers of the Empire.
He immediately pronounced himself Emperor. It is still unknown at this time if
Emperor Naga has a legitimate heir should ill befall him.

Emperor Naga has ruled the Empire of Toran for over two years now, and
things are well - if not stressful. Tensions with the Empire of Nelva are
up again, and Naga seeks to gain the favor of the Dwarves of the Storm Horns in
order to secure weapons and armors for his armies. It is a very uncertain time
within the Empire, and war seems as if it could come at any time...

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

CLASS-CLERIC
@n The cleric is the ultimate divine spellcaster, and testament to the power of
 the pantheon. Wielding spells and abilities gifted to them by their gods, the
 cleric can serve as anything from a goodly healer to an agent of destruction.
 Unlike many other spellcasters, he can wear heavy armor without casting penalty
 although he still must train to use martial weapons.

 Like the gods they serve, clerics can be of any alignment. Typically, clerics
 are the same alignment as their deity, although some are one step away from
 their respective deities alignment.

@YCleric Class Features@n
 Alignment:    Any (Same as deity, or one step removed)
 Hit Die:      d8
 Primary Stat: Wisdom

@YSpells@n
 A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However,
 his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or
 ethical beliefs.

 A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance using the @Ymem@n command.
 Ex: mem bless
     mem cure-light-wounds

 A cleric casts spells using the @Ypray@n command.
 Ex: pray <spell> <target>

 To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least
 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a clerics
 spell is 10 + the spell level + the clerics Wisdom modifier. 

@YClass Skills@n
 Combat Tactics (Dex), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),
 Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Lore (Int), Spellcraft (Int).

@YDomain Class Skills@n
 A cleric who chooses the Travel domain adds Survival (Wis) to their class
 skill list. A cleric who chooses Trickery adds Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha),
 and Hide (Dex) to their class skill list.

@YDomains@n
 A cleric, after choosing their deity, selects two domains from that deity's
 portfolio. These domains grant the cleric access to specific domain spells
 as well as potential extra abilties. Type help domains for a listing of
 domains, and help domain <name> for a specific domain listing.

 Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4
 Skill Points at Each Level:  2 + Int modifier

@YWeapon and Armor Proficiency@n
 All simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, heavy), and
 with shields (except tower shields). Each deity has a favored weapon, and
 his or her clerics consider it a point of pride to wield that weapon. A
 cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to
 that weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon
 Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.

For a table explaining Cleric level gains, type @Yhelp table cleric@n.
For a spell table for Clerics, type @Yhelp spelltable cleric@n.
For a spell listing for Clerics, type @Yhelp spelllist cleric@n.
To cast a cleric spell, type @Ypray@n.

COMPARE
  The compare command will let you determine the worth of an object as
compared to another similar object. For example you would compare a dagger
and a mace. Or perhaps two types of armor. The syntax would be:

 compare <object1> <object2>
 compare dagger mace

EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.  When
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
Things you should know about experience points:

  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.

  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get bonus
    experience points.  If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

FLAGS

Players sometimes have FLAGS after their names in the WHO list.  These
flags are always in parentheses, not brackets or braces.

  FLAG        MEANING

              can try to kill him/her without being flagged.
  (THIEF)     Player is trying to steal from other players.  Fire away.
  (invis)     Player is invisible; you can see him/her because you are

GUILD

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world.  Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building.  Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade.

HOUSES

Houses have been implemented as of CircleMUD 3.0.  A house entails two things:
access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house and
quit; your objects will drop to the ground and be crash-saved for when you
return.  There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be
stored in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher
premium for the convenience of houses; contact your local Implementor for
a fee schedule.

INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 30 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 60 days.

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

UnusedMagicUser

This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user do not

MANA

Mana is used when casting spells.  You must have a certain amount of mana
in order to cast any particular spell.  If you do not have enough mana to
cast the spell you must rest until you gain enough points to cast.

4 COMMUNICATION
@nThere are quite a few forms of communcating with other players in the game.
These forms can be broken into two seperate sections, OOC and IC, or rather,
out of character and "in character".
@n
The first form we're going to go over is out of character communication.
This is the type of communication to use when trying to converse as a player
as opposed to as a roleplayed character. To say something out of character to
everyone in your current room, simply type "ooc" followed by what you would
like to say. For example: ooc how do I set my recall point to here?
@n
You can also communication OOC globally to everyone in the game via the "chat"
channel. Simply type "chat" followed by what you would like to say.
For example: chat How do I join a quest?
@n
If you are in a group of adventurers, you may want to specifically talk to
just members of your group. To do this, type "gt" for grouptalk, followed
by what you'd like to say.
@n
Finally, there is a direct means of communication between players known as
tells To use a tell, type "tell" followed by the persons name, followed
then by your message. For example: tell mask Stop playing tricks on meeee!
@n
There is also in character communcation. Think of these following forms of
communication as a way to roleplay your character. Roleplay can be reviewed
by the administration of the game and rewarded for quality.
@n
To say something in character to everyone in the room, type "say" followed by
what you would like to say.
@n
To shout something to everyone within an area, type "shout" followed by what
you'd like to shout about.
@n
To bellow something at a great distance to everyone in the game, you need to
holler as hard as you can. Type "holler" followed by your epic message which
will ring from the mountains to the valleys below.
@n
There are also "socials". Socials are fun built in expressions and actions
that can be used alone, or targetting another player. For a list for socials,
type "socials" by itself. To enact a social, simply type the social name,
followed optionally by a target.
For example: @Cscratch self@n
For example: @Cwink Ilmater@n

NEWBIE "GETTING STARTED" "STARTING OUT" "WHAT TO DO" "WHAT DO I DO?"

Welcome to d20MUD: Age of Dragons, an Open Gaming License rules MUD
(d20 system, D&&D 3.5e, Pathfinder) set in a 4th Age Dragonlance theme.

We are happy to have you with us, but believe it fair to warn you that
this game comes with a steep learning curve that even veteran MUDders
may experience.  Furthermore the game is in a state of very active
development, and so crashes may be frequent.  If these two things are
fine by you, then by all means, please continue. :)

After you have finished creating your character, you should follow
the path until you arrive in Palanthas Centre Square, where there
should be a mysterious old lady waiting for you, with a yellow (if color
is on) tagline that says she has a quest.  You are best off starting
your journey doing the main quest line started by her.  It is still
in the process of being created, but it will help introduce you to both
the theme, the atmosphere and the zones of the MUD.  You can view the
quests a quest master has by typing @Yquest list@n, and you can join
a quest by typing @Yquest join <number in list>@n.  For more info see
@YHELP QUESTS@n.

Once you're under way on the quest line you will benefit from some
commands and help files that will introduce some concepts unique to
our MUD.  Please read these help files, even if you're familiar with
the concepts from other MUDs, as there are concepts unique to our MUD
in them.

Please see the following help files:
NEWBIE-GUIDE
MAP-PALANTHAS
CRAFTING (and all sub help files within)
WISHLIST
BACKUP
BOUNTIES
DEATH
GOLD
MAIL
PETITION

If you are a spellcasting class please see the following help files:
CAST
MEMORIZE
CONTAIN

If you have any questions at any time, please send a mail to Majere
using the mail command, or by asking him when you see him online
(though he may be afk and take some time to respond, he is usually
online while at work).

Happy MUDding, and once again... welcome :)

NEWBIE-GUIDE NEW-PLAYER-GUIDE GUIDE

Welcome to the game.  As you will come to see, if you haven't already,
this game comes with something of a learning curve, especially if you
are new to d20 rules.  If that is the case type @YHELP D20@n.

Currently, the only starting city is Palanthas, which is the home
of the Knights of Solamnia and Forces of Whitestone.  Once you finish
character generation you will find yourself at a fountain with a
mysterious old lady and perhaps a few players there.  If you do see
any players there, try to strike up a conversation with them, using
the ooc or rsay commands.  The latter is an in character, role play
say command, which will allow you to earn experience and other bonuses
simply by talking to other people while pretending to be the character
you're playing.

You'll notice that the mysterious old lady mob is a quest giver.  The
first thing you want to do when you're ready to kill things is type
'quest join 1'.  This will join the first quest.  Then go east 5 times
and north once, then up.  Once here in the Gardens of the Blue Phoenix
kill sparrows until you finish the quest.

Combat is turn based, with autoattack turned on by default.  There are
still a few glitches in the combat system, so bear with us if you notice
something wierd happen, we are working on it.  Remember that in d20 rules
you get a standard, move and minor action to do each round.  Different
things use different types of actions, but in order to get more than one
attack per round you generally need to attack first, and do your other
actions afterwards.

A few things you can try between rounds that only use minor or move 
actions are kick, trip, intimidate, challenge and taunt.  Some of those
are debuffs, and kick does extra damage while trip will cause them to
fall losing ac and giving you an attack of opportunity when they stand
back up.

Once you finish the sparrow quest, go back to the fountain and type
quest join 2.  This time you'll be killing squirrels in the gardens.
After this quest you should have enough experience to gain a level.
Do so by using the levelup command and following the on-screen prompts.

At this point you are level 2.  You have a few options from here.  You
can do bounties at Shandra in the the Inn of the Platinum Dragon between
the gardens and the fountain on the north side of the street.  Type 
'bounty new' to get a random bounty for your general level range, or,
as most people prefer, specify the mob you want to kill.  Be as specific
as possible with your keywords.  For example 'bounty new floppy,white,rabbit'
will give you a bounty to kill rabbits in the gardens, which you can also
team up with the repeatable quest at the fountain for double rewards.  Please
note that you separate keywords with commas for the bounty command (and other
areas of the game) and that you may also need to preceed the keywords with
2. 3. 4. 10. and so forth depending on how many different types of mobs
share those key words.

You can also continue the quest line, though you will need to level up
some by doing bounties, repeatable quests, or just killing things for some
of the quests.  To take this route do the rabbit quest and then go back to
the fountain and type quest join 4.  Keep following the quest line.  Currently
it will take you up to around level 8, and a couple of times during that
journey you will likely need the aid of others to defeat bosses.

Another option is to explore the world.  There are very few areas of the world
right now that are dangerous for newbies to explore.  And the good thing is
you gain experience just by going to places you've never been before.

You can also find some players and role play.  When you use the rsay, emote,
shout or rgsay channels, you get experience and other rewards just for role
playing.

Finally you can try your hand at crafting.  For this we recommend you read
the HELP CRAFING help file and all files referred within it.  Supply orders
are the best place to start with crafting.

Once you get up to level 3 or so, you can start using magical gear.  We've
created an emporium south and west of the fountain using the emporium command
to list and purchase magical gear using quest points you've accumulated doing
quests and bounties.  We recommend you get yourself some magic weapons, armor,
and a few trinkets with natural and delfection ac.  The higher your ac and the
better your weapons, the faster you'll be able to level.  Please note that
stat wise, for all ac types, ac bonuses are multipled by 10.  So for a suit of
+1 armor D&D rules wise, you actually want a suit of +10 armor.

You'll also find some magic gear during your travels, as well as crystals and
power essences.  The latter two are used in custom crafting, through which
you will be able to make gear with your own descriptions.  You can even restring
gear you find to have better descriptions more in line with your character
concept if you like.

That should be enough to get you started on yor journey.  Though I would like to
give a short list of commands that you might find useful:

automap - turns on an ascii map of the surrounding area
camp - uses survival skill to set up a campfire that will improve regen rates
callmount - calls a mount you've purchased (see the vendor at the south gate)
mount - allows you to mount your mount, animal companion or summoned creature
backup - creats a backup of your rent file in case we need to reimburse you.
chat - global channel used for asking questions or general ooc talk
newbie - global channel specific for new players and their questions
spon - toggles spontaneous casting for clerics and druids to cast heals/summons
innate - allows you to use any innate abilities tied to your class/race
random - for making random dice rolls for ooc, skill use or rp purposes
mentor - allows you to reduce your effective level for grouping with lower level
         characters

If at any time you have a question feel free to ask.  We are a friendly group.
Also feel free to use the petition system (HELP PETITION) if you ever need
any help whatsoever from a staff member, though often we respond to chat and
newbie as well.

Enjoy the MUD!

D20-SYSTEM

The d20 System is a game system where almost all rolls are done using a 20-sided
die.

Generally the system works in one of two ways:
- You roll a d20, add your skill/attack bonus/ability score bonus
--- You compare it against a set difficulty class (or dc)
--- You compare it against an opposed roll by the opposing player/mob

When the dice roll is equal to or higher than the dc or opposing roll, you succeed
at the task, otherwise you fail.

Character building is an important part of the d20 system.  Often experienced
players will plan out their entire build at level 1, or at least have a very
good idea of it.  Fortunately we have added a respec command that allows you
to rebuild your character from level 1 for account experience which is easily
gained through role play or mentoring.

We encourage you to test out a number of builds before you settle on one that
fits your play style.

That being said, don't worry too much about having the best character possible
right away.  It's almost impossible to do unless you know both the game and the
d20 system very well.  You can still have an effective character though with
the right gear and the right feats and class combinations.

The beauty of the system is that there are so many combinations that it is almost
unheard of for two people to have the exact same build.  However that may change
as the game grows, as people will find out what works best, and 'cookie cutter'
builds may be made.  But even if that happens, we will ensure that even though
such builds may be popular, any intelligently done build will be effective, so
plan your character based on your own desires, and not based on what people
necessarily say is the best.

We are committed to game balance, so feel assured that if something gives an
unfair advantage, the system will be fixed to accommodate for that one way or
another.

If you ever have a question about d20 rules, a skill or a spell or a feat, or
some other concept that there's no help file for, please visit one of the 
following two web sites for the information you need.  Note that though we don't
always follow these web sites to the 'T', the information you gain should be
relevant enough to help you plan your build in 99% of the cases.

http://www.d20srd.com/
http://www.d20pfsrd.com/

As always, if you have any other question, please ask on chat, newbie or
submit a petition for a GM.

Thanks!

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

CIRCLE CIRCLEMUD CREDITS
                    C  I  R  C  L  E  M  U  D     3  .  0

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMud (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMud folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

OASIS

OasisOLC is the name given to a set of on line editing tools that can be
used by authorized players to examine, change and create the various world
entities that make up the Mud environment.  It is referred to as "on line"
creation because it allows people to create and edit things while the mud
is running, or on line.  This is opposed to the traditional method of editing
the various text files that comprise the mud "world" using various off-line
editors (typically vi or emacs), and the restarting the mud so that the
updated files are reloaded.

Categories of Oasis Commands
----------------------------

1)  Commands to examine the existing mud operation.  These are the [x]list

Using the Editing Commands
--------------------------

All of the edit commands are menu driven.  See OASIS-EDIT for general
instructions on how the menu interface works.

Granting Access to Oasis Commands
---------------------------------

Access to the Oasis commands are controlled through a number of means.  Of
course, the master command list (in interpreter.c) specifies the minimum
level for a player to call the command.  This is typically set to either
LVL_BUILDER, or LVL_GOD.  A few commands are restricted to the implementor.

A player can always edit a zone and its contents if their name is in the 
zone builders list (see ZEDIT for more information).  Finally, a player 
may be granted OLC rights to a specific zone by means of the "set" command,
using "set <player> olc <zone>".

The implementor has unfettered access to all Oasis commands.

External Documentation
----------------------

Refer to "The CircleMUD Builder's Manual" that is shipped with the CircleMUD
distribution, as this provides considerable invaluable information that is 
essential to anyone building on a mud, whether off-line or using Oasis.  The
main reference documentation for OasisOLC can be found at:

OASIS-EDIT

The OasisOLC edit programs make use of a menu interface, and each of the
various commands has a similar appearance.  Each attribute of the thing
you are editing is listed, with a menu number against it.  These numbers
start from the number 1, run through the digits to 9, then use the letters
A onwards.  You enter the number (or letter) corresponding to the item you
wish to change.

Some menu items will lead to sub-menus, for example setting various bit
fields.

In general, the letter "Q" will quit (with the option to save) the menu
level you are currently at, although some sub-menus use the number "0"
to leave the menu.

Types of Menu Items
-------------------

1)  Single value items.  These correspond to attributes that have a single
    value or a simple list.  For example, a room name, an object's weight,
    or the list of aliases for a mobile.  Enter the value(s) and press the
    return key.

2)  Long text fields.  This corresponds to a multi-line text string, such
    as a room's description.  This makes use of the "enhanced edit" text
    editor.  Use the "/h" command in the editor to see the various options.

3)  Multi-value fields.  This is a menu item where you have to enter several
    values, such as an object's value flags, where there can be up to four
    values that you have to enter.  Each value will have its own prompt, so
    enter the value as directed by the prompt, and press the return key.

4)  Bit string fields.  This menu item goes to a sub-menu, with all of the 
    possible bit values listed.  You can select as many values as you wish, 
    with each menu number on this sub-menu toggling its corresponding flag
    on and off.  Use the menu item "0" once you have set all the flags you
    require to return to the top menu.

5)  Multiple choice fields.  This is where the attribute has one of a number
    of possible values, such as an object's type or a room's sector type.
    The sub-menu will list all the possible values, so to choose the value
    you want, enter the menu item number that corresponds to the particular
    choice you want.  This is unlike the bit string field, in that once you 
    make a choice, that value is recorded and you are returned to the upper
    menu.

6)  Sub menus.  Selecting this menu option takes you to a sub-menu where a 
    new set of menu items are listed.  Once you have finished working at 
    this sub-menu level, generally 0 or Q will return you to the upper menu.

Saving Your Changes
-------------------

If you have changed the thing you are working on in any way, taking the 
"Q" option from the top-most menu will save the object, if you respond
with a "Y" at the save object prompt.

the character issuing the command, others in the same room, and the command
victim.  These messages can use substitution parameters as per the act()

The zedit command is used to create new zones, change the characteristics
of existing zones, and create and edit individual zone commands.

The first variant of the zedit command is used to change values for an 
existing zone and add or modify the zone commands that relate to a particular
room.  If no room number is given, zedit will work with the room the player is
currently in, or if a room number is specified, it will work with the zone
that contains that room.  The zedit menu is in two parts, the upper part 
being used to set the overall value for the total zone (zone name, reset
mode, and so on), while the lower part lists the zone commands that relate
to the particular room.

The second variant is used to create a brand new zone, specifying the zone
number and the range of room vnums that the zone contains.  This will bring
up the standard zone edit menu.

The third (and final) variant will save the complete zone to the disk file,
for either the zone specified or, if no zone number was entered, for the 
zone that the player is currently in.

FEATS

Usage: feats  <available | complete | known>

Feats can grant you a number of different things. Some feats allow you to wear
new armor, or wield new weapons. Some feats will give you bonus to skills you
already know, and other feats may grant you entirely new commands!

The feats command will allow you to see various information related to feats in
the game. Available shows you feats which are currently eligible to learn.
Complete shows all feats in the game. Known shows you feats you currently know.
You gain feats as you increase in level.

Without any argument it defaults to feats known. 

Not all feats are currently implemented.

All feats can be accessed by typing help feat <featname>.  If you do not see a help
file for a feat, it has not yet been done.  Please make a note of it with a forum
post or by using the bug command, and then refer to http://www.d20srd.org/ to find the
information you need on the specific feat.

See Also: LEARN, GAIN

#0
LEARN
Usage: learn <feat name> OR learn <featname>:<weapon/skill/spell>

The learn command will allow you to gain new feats as you increase in level.
Use of "feats available" will show you feats which are are currently qualified
to learn. Check the help entry for a given feat to see what it's benifit will
be for you. 

Not all feats are currently implemented.

The train command will allow you to increase the specified attribute by 1 point.
As you increase in levels you will gain training points to help improve your
character stats.

See also: GAIN LEVEL




















#0
MEMORIZE STOP FORGET AUTOMEM

Usage: memorize <spell name>

The memorize command will allow you to manage your memorized spells, if you
are a spell caster. Without any argument it will display information regarding
The spell levels you can learn, the number of spell slots per spell level, any
spells that are currently memorized, and any spells you are still trying to
commit to memory. You can memorize spells without resting, however it takes
much longer. 

There are two kinds of spell casters in the game, Arcane and Divine. Arcane
spell casters need to have a spell book (or scroll) in their inventory with
the spell they wish to memorize. Divine spell casters need to have an item
of divine favor (holy symbol). Currently an item will qualify as an item
of divine favor if it has the ITEM_BLESS flag set on it.

To automatically reme your spells when you cast them type 'automem'

To forget a spell you have memorized type 'forget <spellname>'

To stop memorizing a spell you are currently memorizing type 'stop <spellname>'

#0
FEAT-SCRIBE-SCROLL
Scribe Scroll [Item Creation]

Prerequisite

Caster level 1st

Benefit

You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day for each
1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level * its caster level
* 25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw
materials costing one-half of this base price. Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material
component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the
base price, you must exend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.

Usage: scribe <spellbook|scroll> <spell name>

The scribe command will allow you to take a spell which you have memorized and write it into a
spellbook or scroll.

In order to scribe a scroll into your spellbook you must first memorize the spell on the scroll 
as per normal.  If it is not in your spellbook it will check to see if it is on a scroll, at which
point the scroll will disappear and you will memorize the spell into one of your free mem slots.
If you do not have a free mem slot available you will lose the scroll.  After you have the spell
memorized you can scribe it from memory into the spellbook, or onto a blank scroll if you have 
the scribe scroll feat.

#0
RESURRECT DEATH

Usage: resurrect

This command is for players to use once they have died. Unless they can get
another player to raise them, they will have to use the resurrect command.
While the player is dead they will not be able to interact much with other
players, mobs or objects in the game as they are SPIRITs. In order to resurrect
you must take an experience point penalty.

Resurrecting also reduces your currently carried gold by 1/2. Keeping gold safely
in a bank will prevent it from being taken upon resurrecting.

Please also note that those who self-resurrect who have not chosen a deity using
the devote command will lose twice as much experience.

RACE-ELF RACE-ELVES
Elves are one of the original races, placed on Krynn by the Gods of 
Good in the Age of Starbirth. Elves are tall and slender, with 
almond-shaped eyes, and live for hundreds of years. The first elves
were known as the Colinesti Elves. The various elven sub-races are 
discussed in more detail under their sub-catagories.
The types of elves in Krynn are:
 Qualinesti Elf               
 Silvanesti Elf               
 Kagonesti Elf       

There are also half elf and half human breeds, including:
Half Elf

RACE-DWARF RACE-DWARVES
----------------[ DWARF ]----------------
Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless artisans of the earth. It could be said that their history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors.
#0
GNOME

Gnomes are welcome everywhere as technicians, alchemists, and inventors. Despite
the demand for their skills, most gnomes prefer to remain among their own kind,
living in comfortable burrows beneath rolling, wooded hills where animals abound
but hunting is a very bad idea.

Gnomes adore animals, beautiful gems, and jokes of all kinds. Gnomes have a 
great sense of humor, and while they love puns, jokes, and games, they relish 
tricks -- the more intricate the better. Fortunately, they apply the same 
dedication to more practical arts, such as engineering, as they do to their 
pranks.

Gnomes are inquisitive. They love to find things out by personal experience. At
times they're even reckless. Their curiosity makes them skilled engineers, since
they are always trying new ways to build things. Sometimes a gnome pulls a prank
just to see how the people involved will react.

Gnomes stand about 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin 
ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be 
any shade of blue. Gnomes males prefer short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes 
generally wear leather or earth tones, and they decorate their clothes with 
intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and
they live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.

SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.  (Slap a dragon lately?)

Example:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

  > socials

Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it
receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your
words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an
opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldnt ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An
affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something
very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks
the spell. You must speak the persons language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

SPELL DETECT MAGIC
Detect Magic
Divination
Level: Brd 0, Clr 0, Drd 0, Sor/Wiz 0
Usage: cast 'detect magic'
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 60 ft.
Area: Cone-shaped emanation
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D) 
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

1st Round
Presence or absence of magical auras.

2nd Round
Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

3rd Round
The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you
can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura;
DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength
An auras power depends on a spells functioning spell level or an items caster level. If an aura falls into
more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

                                        Aura Power
Spell or Object                  Faint   Moderate   Strong   Overwhelming
Functioning spell (spell level)  1-3      4-6         7-9      10th+ (deity-level)
Magic item (caster level)        1-5      6-11        12-20    21st+ (artifact)

Lingering Aura
A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the
case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura
strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its
original power:

Original Strength    Duration of Lingering Aura
Faint                1d6 rounds
Moderate             1d6 minutes
Strong               1d610 minutes
Overwhelming         1d6 days

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell
registers.

Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone,
1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

MFORGET MREMEMBER %FORGET% %REMEMBER%

mremember <victim> [command]

   The victim is placed into this mobile's memory list. The next time the 
victim is seen by the mobile, the mobile will perform command if set, or 
execute the memory trigger if no command was provided. When the command is 
carried out or the script executed, the victim is forgotten.

NOTE: Any mob using the mremeber command MUST have a MEMORY trigger attached. 
It doesn't matter if the Memory trigger is never called (Narg 0).
Only Mobs may use mremember.

mforget <victim>
   Remove victim from this mobile's memory list. 

Example: @RTSTAT 74@n
         @RTSTAT 75@n




















#0
MGOTO %GOTO%

%goto% <target>
   This command moves the mob to the given target. The target may be an object,
room, or  character, as long as it is not in a private room occupied with two 
or more characters, or god  room. No message is given. 

%goto% 1233
%goto% Rumble
%goto% fountain




















#0
MJUNK %JUNK%

mjunk <object | all>
   
   The object in the mob's inventory specified is removed from the game. 
'Mjunk all' removes all of the objects in the mob's inventory. No message 
is sent by this command. Only mobs may use this command.




















#0
%FOLLOW% TRIG-FOLLOW MFOLLOW

mfollow <victim>
   The mobile will begin following the victim without the revealing "starts
following you" message. A silent follow.

Examples: @RTSTAT 40, 39@n




















#0
MHUNT %HUNT% HUNT 

mhunt <victim>
   The mobile will begin to hunt for victim, and engage in combat upon finding 
them. Only Mobiles may use this command. Hunting mobs will walk through NOMOB
rooms.

*mobs do not currently engage upon finding, it is bugged.

Examples: @RTSTAT 41, 202, 19596, 19695@n




















#0
%KILL% WKILL OKILL MKILL

mkill <victim>
mkill %actor%
   mkill causes the mob to hit the victim. It is the same as kill, except mkill 
works for low level mobs attacking PCs, where kill might not.




















#0
%TRANSFORM% MTRANSFORM OTRANSFORM TRANSFORM

%transform% <vnum|-vnum>

   This command causes the executing mob or object to transform into another 
mob or object, based on the vnum argument supplied. The transformation is 
permanent, though additional transformations may be performed. No message 
regarding the transformation is sent to the room. The new mob or object will 
have the same script as the original, rather than any script normally assigned 
to the new, and no load trigger will be executed.

   Mobs - The hit points, max hit points, position, gold, and experience value 
will remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions 
will be those of the new mob. (The new mob can be made to have all of its normal 
statistics by using a negative vnum.) Only mobiles may use this command (naturally).

   Objects - Based on the vnum argument supplied. The four basic values will 
remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions will 
be those of the new object. The transformation is permanent, additional 
transformations may be performed. No message regarding the transformation is 
sent to the room. The new object will have the same script as the originating 
object, rather than any script normally assigned to the new object, and no 
load trigger will be executed.

Example: @RTSTAT 21, 1370@n




















#0
OTIMER %TIMER% 

otimer <value>

   Set the countdown timer of this object to value. Useful for objects with 
timer triggers.




















#0
OSETVAL %SETVAL%

osetval <position> <value>

   Osetval lets you alter the object values of an object. The meaning of the 
values depends on the object type (@RHELP OEDIT-VALUES@n).




















#0
COMMENT * 

* This is an example of a comment in trigedit. Because of the *'s the lines 
* are not parsed, so the script still works even if it has a lot of 
* explanations built in. All triggers should be heavily commented.

* The below line sends the text 'Trigger firing' to the room.
%echo% Trigger firing

   Comments are useful in scripts to document what is happening, for future 
reference, and for others to see what the script does.

See also: REDIT-ROOM-FLAGS




















#0
NOP

   Almost a no-operation. Certain variable/subfield combinations for characters 
change some attribute about the character. nop allows those changes to be used 
legally on lines that do not need to process the result.

* this will award the actor with 10 gold
nop %actor.gold(10)%
* this awards 10 experience
nop %actor.exp(10)%

Here is a workaround to use a variable:
  *nop workaround
  eval making %%self.gold(%coins%)%%
  nop %making%





















#0
GLOBALS GLOBAL-VARIABLES GLOBAL-VARS GVARS

Usage: global variablename
* To make a variable 'reachable' from other scripts it has to be made 'global'. 
* In this case I make a local known var %has_bribed_guard% and make it global. 
* It's a good idea to use this in conjunction with context.
global has_bribed_guard

   Used to change a variable from local to global. If a global variable is 
modified, this command must be used to update the global contents as well.

Example: @RTSTAT 45@n

See Also: VARIABLES, CONTEXT




















#0
CONTEXT

Usage: context number
* This little script will make sure one %has_said_hello% exist for each player.
context %actor.id%
set has_said_hello 1
global has_said_hello
* now only scripts running with context = %actor.id% can access this particular 
* variable. however - it's a better idea to use vars set on players: help remote.

   Changes the "context" of a script to this value. When first run, a script's 
context is 0. When a variable is made global, it is given the current context. 
When a variable is accessed, if it must be searched for globally, a "found" 
variable must either have context 0 or the current context. The net result of 
this is you may have many global variables in a single script, with the same 
name, differing only by context. Players may have variables; this mostly 
removes the need for variable context. Previously, a player's ID could be used 
as variable context to allow a script to service multiple players at once.

See Also: REMOTE




















#0
EVAL

Usage: eval <variable> <expression>

* this example immediately evaluates the expression below and stores the result
* in %result%:
eval result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
* this result will not change after the evaluation even if %self.hitp% changes.

   The eval command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the result of the immediate evaluation of the provided expression. There also 
exists a "set" command, with the same syntax. Set differs in that the expression
is not evaluated until the variable is accessed.

See Also: TRIG-SET




















#0
TRIG-SET

Usage: set <variable> <value>

Set sets variable to value, without evaluating it. 
 Example: set foobar 15 - 5
 sets the variable foobar to the string "15 - 5"

* this example sets the value of result to '%self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp%'
set result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
* The %result% var now works as a 'function' every time it's accessed.
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
%damage% %self% 30
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%

   The set command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the provided expression, which will be evaluated when the variable is accessed. 
There also exists an "eval" command, with the same syntax. Eval differs in that 
the expression is evaluated immediately.

See Also: EVAL




















#0
UNSET

Usage: unset variable
* in this example we have a var %testvar% we no longer need:
set testvar hops happily along
%echo% %self.name% %testvar%
unset testvar
* please note - if we had made the var global, it'd be gone instead.

   Remove the variable from the global variables of this script, or if not 
found there, from the script.

See Also: SET, EVAL




















#0
EXTRACT

Usage: extract to-variable word-number from-text
* could be used to do strange things to what people say:
extract testvar1 1 %speech%
extract testvar2 2 %speech%
extract testvar3 3 %speech%
extract testvar4 4 %speech%
say do you mean %testvar4% %testvar3% %testvar2% %testvar1% ?

   Place a specific word from the 'from-text' into a new or existing variable 
'to-variable'. Do not enclose the name of the to-variable in %'s.




















#0
IF ELSEIF END

Usage: if (expression)
...
 elseif (expression)
...
 else
...
 end
   if (if %actor.vnum% == -1) 
     %echo% You are a player
   else 
     %echo% You are a mob.
   end

   An 'if' must occur before the other three. If expression evaluates to true 
(@RHELP EXPRESSIONS@n), the statements between the if statement and the next 
elseif, else, or end are executed. If it stopped at an elseif or else, it scans 
for the next end, and continues execution at that point. If the expression 
evaluated to false, it searches for the next elseif, else, or end. If it finds 
an elseif, it checks that expression. If it is true, it executes the statements 
between the elseif and the next elseif, else, or end, and then finds the end of
the block. If it is false, it continues searching in the same pattern, until a 
true elseif is found, an else is found, or an end is found. There may be 0 or 
1 else statements and 0 or many elseif statements in the block.

For anyone having trouble with the format of if/elseif/else/end blocks
@RTSTAT 22@n. Relsqui made this excellent example.

***EVERY IF NEEDS AN END: 2 IF'S NEEDS 2 ENDS....***

See Also: EXPRESSIONS, NESTED




















#0
NESTED-IFS

   A nested if is an if statement contained within another if or if...else 
statement. Nested if's allow the creation of a decision tree or flow chart
of events with multiple conclusions. 
   Always use /f to format and indent your trigger. This will warn you if you
do not have the correct number of ifs to ends. @RWARNING:@n multiple unmatched
if/ends will crash us. Make sure everything lines up with /f before you test.
 
Example: @RTSTAT 1490, 41000@n




















#0
HALT

Usage: halt

   Halt terminates the trigger execution.    

* This script attacks players of level 20 and above. The reason for the use of 
* halt and return 0 is to make sure other scripts are checked too.
if %actor.level% < 20
  return 0
  halt
end
  %echo% %self.name% yells a Battlecry and throws himself at you.
  mkill %actor%

   Terminates the trigger execution.




















#0
MAKEUID VAREXISTS %VAREXISTS% %EXISTS% EXISTS

Usage: makeuid variable id
* We have one mob giving a quest. This mob sets the targets id as a global on 
* the player via the 'remote' command, like this:
eval quest_object %obj.id%
remote quest_object %actor.id%
* We then have another mob receiving the quest object, with the following script.
if !(%actor.varexists(quest_object)%)
  return 0
  halt
end
* now we know the player has a quest_object variable
makeuid obj %actor.quest_object%
say Have you brought me %obj.shortdesc%, %actor.name% ?
say You must bring it to me to complete your quest, you know.

   Creates a new variable with the name given, whose contents shall be suitable 
for referring to a character, object, or room whose id is provided.




















#0
RDELETE

Usage: rdelete variable id
* This is used to remove a variable
say Thank you, %actor.name% - your quest is completed.
rdelete quest_object %actor.id%

   Delete a remote variable from the script referred to by the id of its owner.

See Also: VDELETE, REMOTE




















#0
REMOTE

Usage: remote <variable> <id>

Remoting a variable saves that variable to the player file for future access. 
This is used heavily for quests to limit a player to only performing it once.
Here is a quick example from zone 14. The variable must first be set and then
saved to the players file via remote, like:
  * setting the variable to 1 means completed.
  set solved_example_quest_zone_14 1
  remote solved_example_quest_zone_14 %actor.id%
Then in future triggers it is checked if that variable already exists in the
player file. In this example, if it does the player is not allowed to continue.
<variable> should always be a unique name. I suggest always including zone #.
<id> can be any value or text you wish to use later.

   Create a global variable belonging to a character or player whose id is 
specified. The variable must first exist in the script that is running.

For more examples go through the trigedit hallway.
Examples: @RTSTAT 1409-1411, 23612-23614@n

See Also: RDELETE, VDELETE, TRIG-SET, CONTEXT




















#0
TRIG-RETURN
 
Usage: return 0
 
   Return sets the return value of the trigger. Normally, a script will return
1, unless return 0 is specified. Unlike most computer languages, the return  
command does not end the trigger's execution. The value is returned after all 
the commands have been executed, or a wait or halt command is called. 

Example: @RTSTAT 1364@n

See Also: HALT, WAIT




















#0
TRIG-SWITCH TRIGEDIT-SWITCH CASE DEFAULT BREAK

Usage: switch expression
    
switch %random.4%
  case 1
    emote sings a merry song about someone named Fulbert and Beatrice.
  break
  case 2
    emote booms out loudly, 'Heigh Ho! Heigh Ho! It's home from work we go!'
  break
  case 3
    emote tries to sing falsetto, but his voice doesn't agree.
  break
  default
    sing
  break
done

   Switch evaluates an expression and looks for a match amongst the case 
statements that follow. If none of the following case statements are a match, 
and a default statement exists, the default statement is considered a match. 
If a match is found, the commands that follow it, up until a break or done 
command, are executed. 
Break is used to terminate commands in a switch. 
Case is used to begin a new conditional group in a switch block.
Default is similiar to case but matches any condition not met. 
Done is used to terminate a while or switch block.

Examlpe: @RTSTAT 18@n




















#0
WHILE DONE

Usage: while expression

   The while command starts a loop, running until the expression becomes zero 
or negative. This can make permanent loops - be careful. The switch block must 
be terminated by a done. While loops are disabled after looping 100 times.

Room example: @RTSTAT 24@n
Obj example:  @RTSTAT 23@n




















#0
WAIT WAITUNTIL WAIT-UNTIL PAUSE TRIGEDIT-TIMING TIMING

Usage: wait <time> [s]
       wait until <mudtime>
* This script gives the actor 10 seconds to get out.
say GET OUT! NOW!
wait 10 s
mkill %actor%

   The wait statement is used to 'pause' the script execution for a period of 
time. When a script is being executed it will attempt to execute all commands 
right away. To get small breaks in, and perhaps give the players time to adjust, 
use the wait command.

* If you want to syncronise your script, you can use the 'wait until' feature.
* This script wakes the mob at dawn, and puts him to sleep at night.
wait until 8:00
wake
* wait # without seconds following it will wait 10 ticks, which is very quick.
wait 10 
yawn
wait 10
stand
* This one uses wait 10 seconds. Recommend you always use seconds
wait 10 sec
emote looks sleepy.
wait until 21:00
yawn
wait 10 s
rest
wait 10 s
sleep

TRIGEDIT-VARIABLES VARIABLES TRIG-VARS TRIG-VARIABLES VARS 

Variables appear as a name surrounded by '%'s, such as %actor% 

Before a command is processed, the line is scanned and any variables are
replaced. First the list of local variables are checked to see if the variable
is there. If not, the global variables are checked. A proper global match must
have a zero context or the current context of the script. (When a script starts
running, its context is 0. The script context command may be used to change
context.) If a match is still not found, a list of 'built in' variables (ones
not declared by the script) are checked. If no match is found, the variable is
replaced with an empty string (the variable is removed from the line, and
nothing added in its place).

There are two types of variables, local and global. All local variables are
deleted when a trigger finishes executing, and can only be used by the trigger.
Global variables remain until removed with unset, or the script is removed. 

Global variables also have a context associated with them. By default, the
context is 0. Any global being referenced with a context of zero will be seen.
Through the 'context <value>' command, a script may set its context to any
integer; Globals created are always assigned the current script context. When a
global is referenced, if it's context is not 0 or the current context of the
script, it will not be seen. This technique allows, among other things, arrays
of globals to be created by using a series of contexts as indexes. Also, it
allows globals to be associated with a specific character, room, or object in
the game, by using the id of the target as the context. 

Variable Fields 

A field of a variable can also retrieved, based on their type. To get a field,
a notation of %variable.field% is used. The valid fields are listed in the help
files below. 

@RCHAR-VAR@n - Variables for characters.    @RTSTAT 27@n
@ROBJ-VAR@n  - Variables for objects.       @RTSTAT 28@n
@RROOM-VAR@n - Variables for rooms.         @RTSTAT 29@n
@RTEXT-VAR@n - Variables for text.          @RTSTAT 30@n
@RSPEC-VAR@n - Variables for special stuff. @RTSTAT 31@n

MUDCOMMAND CMD.MUDCOMMAND %CMD.MUDCOMMAND% %MUDCOMMAND%

   Used to match text to existing commands in the MUD. This will also match
any abbreviations.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED

@RWARNING: long and verbose (wordy)@n

To add life to the worlds circlemud uses something called scripts (or triggers). 
There are three major types of game objects which can use scripts. These are 
mobiles (mobs), objects, and rooms (world objects). Examples of scripts in the 
game are: 

Cityguards screaming 'PROTECT THE INNOCENT! BANZAI! CHARGE!', (a mob script).
A portal that teleports players when they enter it (an object script).
A room that creates a new exit when a player pulls a lever (a room script).

Each game item (room, mobile, or object) can have a script. A script is composed
of one or more triggers, which work in collaboration to define complex actions 
of the game object. A trigger is a definition of an event that the script watches 
for, and list of commands to execute when that event occurs. 

There are several different types of triggers. Each trigger type determines
when the trigger will be checked. For example, a mob speech trigger is checked
every time a character who is in the same room as the mob with the trigger uses
the 'say' command. A room enter trigger is checked every time a character
enters the room. There are two parts of the trigger used to determine if the
trigger's commands are executed when it is checked, the argument and numerical
argument (NArg). Some triggers use both; some may use only one of the two; and
some may use neither. The interpretation of these two fields is dependant on
the type, and is described in more detail on the webpage and in the help files.

When an event in the game occurs, each script in the room where the event 
occurred is checked to see if there are any triggers which are supposed to
react to that event. A trigger currently running (such as from a 'wait'
command) is skipped. Only one trigger of each script will be run by a single
event. For example, if there are two triggers on a script, and both are the
same type with the same arguments, the second trigger will only be run if the
first one is already running. 

Triggers can be of more than one type. For example, to simulate a cursed item,
a trigger on the object could be of types drop, give, and remove. A more common
combined trigger would have both random and global types, so the random trigger
would be checked even when the zone was empty. Combined triggers must have the
same argument and numerical argument. 

The other component of a trigger is the command list. This is a series of
commands that are executed when the trigger is run. Commands are chosen from
two groups of commands, script specific commands and game commands. Script
specific commands are those commands that only the script interpreter can
recognize. These include flow control commands (such as if, elseif, else, end,
halt, wait, and return), and commands to manipulate variables (such as set,
eval, unset, and global). Game commands are those commands that a player could
issue from their command line as well as special commands added for mobiles,
objects, and rooms.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL

This section is a step by step tutorial to explain the writing of scripts 
(triggers). It goes through the script creation process developing a practical
script. 

Decide what you want the script to do. 
   Consider how your mob, item, or room should behave. Doing this before
worrying what can be done prevents you from limiting yourself to what you have
seen other scripts do, and allows you to produce a more interesting script. 
  
For example, I want to create a gate guard for a small walled town. The ruler
of the town has decided that each group of people will be charged ten coins to
enter his domain. The gate guard must notify travelers of the cost to enter,
collect the money, allow people who have payed to enter the city, and close the
gate after them. This will be a mob script. 
  
Decide what trigger types you need.
   Look through the section on triggers to see the currently available trigger
types. New trigger types can be added by one of the implementors if needed. All
types are listed in the help files @RHELP TRIGEDIT-TYPE@n.
  
Our gate guard needs to react to five different events: 

1. A character entering the room from the south, the road leading away from the
   town, needs to be informed of the price for entrance. This will be a greet
   trigger. 
2. When the guard is given ten or more coins, the guard must open the gate. This
   is done by a bribe trigger. 
3. If the guard is given less than ten coins, the guard needs to inform the
   character that it is insufficient. This is also a bribe trigger. 
4. When someone passes through the gate into the city, the guard must close the
   gate behind them. This is done with an act trigger. 
5. When the gate is opened from the other side, the guard must eventually close
   it. This will be another act trigger. 

Determine the argument and the numerical argument of the triggers. Read the 
specifications on trigger types, and decide what the values for argument and 
Numeric Arg must be for the trigger to react appropriately to the events.
  
@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-GREET@n
Argument    : not used 
Numeric Arg : the percent chance that the trigger is run when checked. Since I 
              want it run every time someone enters the room, it should be 100. 

@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE@n
Argument    : not used
Numeric Arg . minimum number of gold pieces required to activate this trigger.
              The guard should only open the gate when given 10 coins, so it
              should be 10. 

For the second bribe trigger, the guard must respond whenever someone gives 
him 1 or more coins, so Numeric Arg should be 1. 

@RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-ACT@n
Argument    : the text the mob should react to. Since I want the guard to 
              react to a character going north, argument should be "leaves 
              north." 
Numeric Arg : Since argument is a phrase, NArg should be 0. 

The second act trigger should trigger on text "The gate is opened from the other
side", so it is triggered whenever someone opens the gate from inside the town.
Again, Numeric Arg should be 0 for a phrase. 
  
Write the list of commands for the trigger.
This is the most complex and time consuming part of a trigger to write. The
valid commands are explained in the help files and on the webpage. Variables 
and expressions are also used in the commands list.

For the greet trigger, I want the guard to inform anyone entering from the
south how to get into the city. First, I must check if the character is
entering from the south. If they are entering from that direction, the guard
should tell the character the cost of entry. The command list for this trigger
will be as follows: 
  
if (%direction% == south) 
 wait 1 sec
 emote snaps to attention as you approach. 
 wait 1 sec
 say Admittance to the city is 10 coins. 
end 
 
Checking the specifications of the greet trigger, we see that the variable
"direction" is set to the direction that the character entered. The percent
sign surrounding direction means it is a variable. The two equal signs together
compare the value of the variable to the word "south". If these are equal, the
statements between this line and the line "end" will be executed. The "wait 1 sec"
pauses briefly while the character finishes his move. (The greet trigger is
actually checked before the character enters the room, so if we did not have
this line, he or she would never see the guard snap to attention.) After
another brief pause, the guard announces the cost to enter the town. The
indentations are not needed, but make it easier to read. 

The guard must open the gate if ten or more coins were given to him. The
command list looks like this: 
  
wait 1 sec
unlock gate 
open gate 
wait 10 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
After a brief wait (so everything doesn't happen at once), the guard unlocks
the gate and opens it. The guard will close the gate after 10 seconds, even if
no one passes through it. 

The guard must inform the character that his payment was not enough, and
return the money. The commands list will be: 
  
wait 1 sec
say This is not enough! 
give %amount% coins %actor.name% 
  
For the line "give %amount% coins %actor.name%", the variables amount and actor,
both set when the bribe trigger is called, are substituted into the line before
the guard performs the command. The gate guard returns the number of coins he
was given. 

For the first act trigger, I want the guard to close and lock the gate after
someone passes through the gate. The guard should wait briefly so he isn't
shutting the gate on the character's back, and close and lock the gate. The
command list will be: 

wait 1 sec
close gate 
lock gate 
  
For the last act trigger we want the guard to close and lock the gate when it 
is opened from the other side. The commands will look like: 
  
wait 5 sec 
close gate 
lock gate 
  
The "wait 5 sec" gives time for someone on the other side to get through the gate. 
Decide the order of the triggers. The triggers are checked from first to last.
If there are two triggers of the same type, the first one run will be the only
one run. 

There are two sets of triggers which are the same type, the bribe triggers and
the act triggers. If the bribe trigger with the Numeric Arg of 1 is first, the 
other trigger would never be run, since ten or more coins is still one or more. 
In order for my triggers to work right, the trigger with Numeric Arg of 10 must 
be before the trigger with the NArg of 1 in the list. The other possible 
conflict is with the act triggers. Since both have arguments that will not 
occur together, the order does not matter. 

Create the trigger file.
Simply use trigedit to create your triggers and they will be saved for you
when you exit the editor. 

Put the triggers into the game.
In the OasisOLC medit / redit / oedit menus, use menu option S to enter the
script editor. Then select the triggers that will be part of your script. Note,
that order is important! If there are two possible triggers that could both be
executed at the same time, only the first one found in the list will be
activated. In this example, it means place the bribe trigger for 10 or more
coins BEFORE the bribe trigger for 1 coin. 

Test the script.
You should see how the script actually works in the game, and watch other
people interact with it. Often you will see ways you can improve it. 

@RGOTO 1310@n and work your way north to test these out. Triggers 4-8.

TRIGGER-EDITORS

A trigger consists of the type, information on when to execute it, a list of
commands, and a list of variables. Each class of game object (mobiles, objects,
and rooms) have their own set of triggers. 




















#0
TRIGEDIT-NAMES TRIG-NAMES

1) Name         : @ynew trigger@n

Always use names that explain the trigger. More importantly: always include the
VNUM for the mob/obj/room the trigger is going to be attached to.

   It's important to give your trigger a name you and others can understand. 
Even more important is including the VNUM of what it is attached to. This way
tlist and stat will show the name description and VNUM allowing others to 
quickly comprehend what the trigger does. A good name could be 'guard shout for
help - 101' or 'mage cast poison - 300' even 'cursed object - 130.'

Examples:
   Quest Offer - 1310       --> trigger attached to mob 1310
   Fall Down Stairs - 1300  --> trigger attached to room 1300
   No Dropping Stuff - 1301 --> trigger attached to obj 1301




















#0
TRIGEDIT-INTENDED

2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
This is either Mobiles (the default), Objects or Rooms. While in most cases it 
is possible to make a script work for either one, it is highly recommended to 
only use the correct type.

0: Mobiles, 1: Objects, 2: Rooms: 0





















#0
TRIGEDIT-TRIGGER-TYPES

3) Trigger types: @yGreet@n
This is a bitvector  of which kind of events this trigger is triggered by. This 
is the most important part of the trigger. It's here you decide if you want the 
trigger to react on people dying in the room, dropping objects, saying stuff, 
entering, jumping insanely up and down or whatever else you might think of.

This part is also the most important, in the sense that the rest of the triggers' 
info means different things, depending on what trigger type the trigger has. 

For a full listing of types see: @RHELP TRIGEDIT-TYPES@n




















#0
TRIGEDIT-ARGUMENTS ARGUMENTS 

Argument: This describes the text argument, if any, which can be used to
filter out matches to the trigger.

#0
NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS NUMARG NARG TRIGEDIT-NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS TRIGEDIT-ARGUMENTS 

4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments   : 

Dependant on the trigger type, these values will mean different things. For 
instance, if you've decided to use a hitpcnt trigger, the numeric Arg is the 
percent a mobs hit points have to fall to, before the trigger is activated, 
and the command list is executed.





















#0
TRIGEDIT-COMMANDLISTS

6) Commands:
@csay My trigger commandlist is not complete!@n
This is the command list, which contains the actions which take place, when the 
trigger is executed. The command list makes use of the @RHELP TEXT-EDITOR@n.
This is often called the 'script', and is actually a small program, executed 
step by step. In it, you can use different types of commands: script - specific 
commands, flow control commands - if this is a mobile script, you can use 
standard mud commands like say or give.

TRIGEDIT-MOB-TUTORIAL TRIGEDIT-TUTORIAL

Mob trigger tutorial
This mini-quest is setup in TBA as an example. @RGOTO 1310@n and work your way north
with nohassle off.
 
The following 7 steps should give you a general idea about what to do, and how to go 
about making small quests in the dg scripting language. This example is concentrated 
on quests involving mobs. 

The process can be broken down to the following:  
   1. Decide what you want the script to do.
   2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.
   3. Split up the quest.
   4. Find corresponding trigger types.
   5. write the scripts for the triggers.
   6. Attach the scripts - permanently
   7. Done ? 
   
1. Decide what you want the script to do.  
   In this example, we want to make a small mini quest in an area. The quest 
will work like this: When you enter the room, where the first mob is, it will 
start to tell a tale. In this tale, you are instructed to perform a task, in 
this case, kill an evil ogre, that lives in a nearby forest. As proof of the 
kill, you must bring back the ogre's apprehension to the questgiving mob. 

2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.  
   Ingredients for this quest:
      1 Questgiver mob - I've chosen 'the questmaster' - vnum 1310
      1 Target mob - In this case 'an apprehensive Ogre' - vnum 1311
      1 Quest object - 'some apprehension' - trash object, vnum 1300 

3. Split up the quest.  
   Next thing to do is look at the different steps involved with the quest. In 
this example, we have three steps: 
   Player entering room -> tell story 
   Player finds ogre -> load object (Do not just want the mob to carry it) 
   Player gives questmaster apprehension -> reward player 

4. Find corresponding trigger types.  
   Having split the quest up also means we reasonably easy can decide what 
kinds of triggers we need - in this case: 
   mob GREET trigger (attached to questmaster) 
   mob DEATH trigger (attached to ogre) 
   mob RECEIVE trigger (attached to questmaster) 
 
5. write the scripts for the triggers.  
    Up to this point, neither trigedit or the script editors have been used. 
All the info needed is in the help files and on the webpages. Notice most of
the work required is PLANNING! You must know exactly what you want to do before
you do it. Now is the time to fire up trigedit and start editing the triggers. 
Let's give the first one vnum 0, and edit it to look like the script below: 


> trigedit 0
Trigger Editor [0]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Quest Offer@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yGreet @n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* we don't want him to tell this to mobs. vnum -1 is reserved for players.
if %actor.vnum% == -1
  * only greet players coming from the south.
  if %direction% == south
    *wait 1 second, always give the player time before you start sending text.
    wait 1 sec
    say Can you help me, %actor.name%?
    wait 1 sec
    say An apprehensive ogre has something of mine.
    wait 1 sec
    say If you slay him I'll give you all the coins I can spare.
    wait 1 sec
    say Please, bring me the apprehension he has stolen.
  end
end@n

The script above will be executed every time anyone enters the room. If the 
person entering is a mobile, the if check at the beginning will stop the 
execution. Note, that I've named the trigger as I did above. ALWAYS include
the VNUM of where you plan on attaching the trigger. Also, give it a name so 
it is easy to see what part of the quest this trigger handles. The second 
script is very simple.

> trigedit 1
Trigger Editor [1]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1311 - Kill ogre@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yDeath@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@csay you got the best of me %actor.name%.
* load some apprehension
%load% obj 1300
* reload the mob for the next questor
%load% mob 1311@n

The above script will be executed when the mob is killed - just before the 
death cry. The last script just needs to check if the object handed over is 
the correct one. Let's see it, here with vnum 2: 

> trigedit 2
Trigger Editor [2]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example 1310 - Give/Quest Completion@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yReceive@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* check if this was indeed the right object
if %object.vnum% == 1300
  wait 1 sec
  say Thank you, %actor.name%
  %send% %actor% %self.name% gives you a gold piece.
  %echoaround% %actor% %actor.name% is rewarded for his valor.
  nop %actor.gold(1)%
  wait 5 sec
  %purge% obj 1300
else
  * this wasn't the right object - don't accept it
  say I don't want that - bring me back my apprehension.
  return 0
end@n

The script above is pretty self explanatory, but to clarify a bit: First check 
if the object is the correct vnum, then give the reward, and send messages to 
the player and others in the room. If it wasn't the object, reject it, and use 
the return value of the script to prevent the object being passed over. Lastly, 
and very importantly, 'end' ends the if. 

6. Attach the scripts - permanently  
   Proceed and add the scripts to the two mobiles through medit: 

> medit 1310
[medit menu]
Enter choice ? S
     Script Editor

     Trigger List:
     <none>

 N)  New trigger for this script
 D)  Delete a trigger in this script
 X)  Exit Script Editor

     Enter choice :
Here, add the scripts by typing N, then the script vnum: 
Enter choice : n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 0
Enter choice ? n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 2
Enter choice ? x

And add the trigger vnum 3 to the ogre in a similar manner. 

7. Done ?  
   The scripts are now attached to the correct mobs, and the players of your 
mud can now take the quest whenever they wish. This is a great time for 
considering improvements to the little quest: 

Balance issues: 
   Should players get a smaller reward if they perform the quest many times ? 
   Should it be limited to 1 quest per player or 1 per reboot ? 
Gameplay issues: 
   Perhaps other mobs in town should tell the player to go see the old man ? 
   Should the ogre always load the object, or only when people know he has it ? 
   Are there other mobs who would like to pay for that object ? 

The above list is just a few examples. All of them could be implemented, but 
it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

TSTAT TRIGEDIT-EXAMPLES EXAMPLES TRIG-EXAMPLES

Usage: tstat <trigger vnum>

Tstat lets you learn more about a specific trigger. 
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 0 are the basic
examples. For more examples check out zones 13, 19, 27, 29, 77, 236 and 
237. There are numerous others. Look around, just beware some may not be
"good" examples. 

To learn more about any of these just tlist <zone #> then tstat each
trigger individually. You can always ask Rumble to find you an example.

See also: TLIST, TRIGEDIT, OLC




















#0
ATTACH

Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.

Usage: attach mob {trigger vnum/name} {mob name} [location]
       attach obj {trigger vnum/name} {obj name} [location]
       attach room {trigger vnum/name} {room vnum} [location]

   Attach lets you attach a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for
testing or other purposes. The command only attaches the script once,
and will not last over a reboot (or crash).

The 'location' is what number in the triggerlist the trigger will assume.
It is important to first attach a trigger to test before you manually add it
through oedit/medit/redit. 

Examples:
attach room 14500 14520 - Attaches room trigger 14500 to room 14520.
attach mob 1332 santa   - Attaches mob trigger 1332 to mob 1308 (santa).
attach obj 1480 sword   - Attaches obj trigger 1480 to a sword.

#0
DETACH

Builder's working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   

Usage: detach [mob | obj] {target name} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}
       detach room {target vnum | '.'} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}

   Detach removes a script to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for testing or 
other purposes. The command only removes the trigger temporarily, until the
room/obj/mob is reloaded via reboot, zreset, load.

Use the optional arguments 'mob' and 'obj' to differentiate if more entities
with the same alias are in the room.

Examples:
detach room 14500 14520 - remove trigger 14500 from room 14520.
detach room all         - removes all triggers from a room.
detach santa 1332       - detach trigger 1332 from mob 1308 (santa).
detach mob santa all    - detach all triggers from Santa.
detach santa all        - Same as above.
detach sword 1300       - detach trigger 1300 from sword.
detach obj sword 1300   - You guessed it - same as above.
detach sword all        - detach all triggers from the sword.

#0
TRIG-ATTACH

Usage: attach vnum id
* This small trigger will attach a trigger to the carrier this can for instance 
* be used if you want the mob to change attitude by adding another trigger 
* (ie - mob was mad - mob got apple - mob gets a 'nicer' trigger attached
attach 3001 %self.id% 

   This command allows a script to attach a trigger (referenced by vnum) to 
anything capable of receiving triggers, by id number. (%self.id%, %object.id%, 
and %actor.id% are examples of id numbers, for use with this command.)

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-DETACH




















#0
TRIG-DETACH

Usage: detach <vnum | all> id
* if we - as described in the attach example, want our mob/obj/room to behave
* differently, it's not always enough to just add another trigger with attach.
* it might be necessary to remove some old ones :
detach 3000 %self.id%
or
detach all %self.id%

   The opposite of attach, this removes triggers from the specified target.

Example: @RTSTAT 45@n

See Also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-ATTACH




















#0
TLIST TRIGLIST TRIG-LIST TRIGEDIT-LIST 

Usage: tlist <range of vnums or zone number>

Tlist gives you a list of the triggers numbered within the parameters.
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 13, 40, 41 is a 
good start.

   tlist 13          - lists all triggers defined in zone 13
   tlist 4000 4099   - lists all existing triggers from vnum 4000 to 4099

TEXT-EDITOR TEXTEDITOR /d /i /h /s /a /c /ra /l /fi WORDWRAP WORD-WRAP FORMATTING /e#
   The text editor is what you use to write room/mob/obj/extra descriptions,
mudmails, and even boards. It allows you more commands than the typical entry.
To learn the commands while using the text editor, type /h. It will tell you
what all the / commands do. Always use /fi to format, indent, and word wrap.
It looks much better to see writing that is formatted than one that runs all
over the place wrapping around etc. Just simply type /fi on a new line and hit
enter. Before you save type /l to list the buffer and see for yourself how it
looks. Fix as needed.
   When entering the text editor for the first time make sure to use /c to clear
the current contents. Indent and format all descriptions by typing /fi (format
with indent) in the text editor.  This includes all forms of OLC, mudmails,
boards, and anywhere else you use the text editor. This will indent the line
by 3 spaces and wrap your text at less than 80 characters so telnet users can
read it.
 
Editor command formats: /<letter>
 
@n/a         -  aborts editor
@n/c         -  clears buffer
@n/d#        -  deletes a line #
@n/e# <text> -  changes the line at # with <text>
@n/f         -  formats text. 
@n/fi        -  indented formatting of text (highly recommended for all desc's)
@n/h         -  list text editor commands
@n/i# <text> -  inserts <text> before line #
@n/l         -  lists buffer
@n/n         -  lists buffer with line numbers
@n/r 'a' 'b' -  replace 1st occurance of text <a> in buffer with text
@n/ra 'a' 'b'-  replace all occurances of text <a> within buffer with text
        usage: /ra 'pattern' 'replacement'
@n/s         -  saves text

NOTE: /f and /fi in trigedit will autoindent your trigger.
Commands such as /r, /n, /e#, /i#, /d# are invaluable and will make your job
much easier. For example lets say you mistype "the" with "teh" in a 10 line
description. Instead of /c (clearing) the text you can /r 'teh' 'the' or if it
was on line 5 you can type /e5 <line with teh spelled correctly> or /d5. Learn
all these options.

#0
ADVANCE

Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.

Example:

  > advance rasmussen 34

See also: SET




















#0
WIZAT

Usage: at <room VNUM | item | mob | player name> <command> <arguments>

AT can be used to perform an action in a location other than where you are
standing.  The first argument can be a virtual room number or the name of a
character or object.  The remainder of the line is passed to the command
interpreter.

Examples:

  > at 3001 look
  > at fido kill fido
  > at 3.corpse get all corpse
  > at catje wave catje

See also: GOTO




















#0
BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

See also: WIZLOCK




















#0
DATE

Shows the current real time. (Not a social)




















#0
DC

Usage: dc <descriptor number>

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket.  If used on a playing socket,
the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not extract the
player or dump the player's inventory on the ground.

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name" state.

See also: USERS




















#0
DISABLE
Usage: disable <command>
       disable

This will allow any command specified by <command> to be disabled for use. This
can be very handy! With no argument the disable command displays the list of
currently disabled commands in the game. To enable a previously disabled command
you simply disable <command> again.




















#0
ECHO GECHO QECHO SEND

Usage: echo <message>
       gecho <message>
       send <victim> <message>
       qecho <message>

ECHO displays a string to everyone in your room.
GECHO displays the string to everyone in the game.
QECHO displays the string to everyone with the QUEST flag.
SEND displays the string to a particular person.

Examples:

  > echo Hi, everyone in the room.
  > gecho Hi, everyone in the game, isn't this annoying?
  > send rasmussen You are being watched.




















#0
FORCE

Usage: force <victim | all> <command> <arguments>

FORCE forces a character, either monster or player, to perform a certain
action.  FORCE ALL forces everyone in the game; FORCE ROOM forces everyone in
your room.

Example:

  > force fido drop meat
  > force all save
  > force room look fido

If you are invisible to the one being forced, the force will be performed
silently.




















#0
FREEZE THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

See also: SET -> FROZEN




















#0
GOTO TRANS WIZTELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different rooms.
GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from wherever
they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to some other
location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specifier can be either a virtual
room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

Usage: hcontrol build <house vnum> <exit dir> <player name>
       hcontrol destroy <house vnum>
       hcontrol pay <house vnum>
       hcontrol show

House control, controls the addition, removal, and payments of houses.
Hcontrol show will show all the houses currently defined in the game
along with their last 'rent' payment date.

#0
HOLYLIGHT

Usage: holylight

A toggle which allows you to see:
   Invisible people and objects, even if you don't have 'detect invisibility'
   Hidden people, even if you don't have 'sense life'
   Dark rooms, even if you don't have a light

It is expected most immortals will keep HOLYLIGHT on most of the time;
it exists so that you have the ability to see what mortals see for
debugging purposes.




















#0
IMOTD

Usage: imotd

Displays the Immortal message of the day.  This file usually contains
new information on commands recently added, new features and other
important information that immortals should be aware of.

See also: MOTD




















#0
INVIS

Usage: invis [level]

INVIS sets your invisibility level.  With no argument, invis toggles between
making you fully visible and fully invisible.  If you specify a level, only
people at and above the level you specify will be able to see you.

Examples:

  > invis
  > invis 31

See also: VISIBLE




















#0
LAST

Usage: last <player_name>

For checking the last time a person logged on, their sitename, and their
ID number.

Example: 

  > last ras
  [  24] [14 Cl] Ras          : somesite.edu : Tue May 16 22:07:09 1995

See also: STAT




















#0
LOAD

#0
PURGE

Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and equipment
will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her connection.  For this
reason, PURGE should only be used on players in disciplinary situations.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.

SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.




















#0
SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.




















#0
STAT

Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people with
names such as Red or Cityguard.

STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the information
displayed comes from the playerfile.

Examples:

  > stat fido
  > stat player red
  > stat mobile red
  > stat file niandra
  > stat object thunderbolt

#0
STRING

Usage: string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.  The
format is:

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.

Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):

Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at.  For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@@'.

Mobiles and objects currently cannot be strung.




















#0
SWITCH

Usage: switch <monster>

SWITCH is used to take over the body of mobiles; useful for interactive
adventures.  If the monster in which you are switched is killed you will be

COINS GOLD MONEY

   The coin system in Krynn is based upon war, as are all things.  Thus precious
metals such as gold, silver, platinum, while valuable, are not used as the
normal exchange since they have no real use in war.  Instead a system of weighted
coins of various metals used in weapon and armor smithing has been devised by
the populace.  The various metals and coin types are adamantine, mithril, steel
(which is the basic unit), bronze and copper.  

Below is the exchange ratio:

1 adamantite coin = 25 mithril coins
1 mithril coin = 100 steel coins
1 steel coin = 10 bronze coins
1 bronze coin = 10 copper coins

1 INTRODUCTION


First of all, welcome to our game.  This game has been an official work-in-progress
since Feburary of 2005, and before that has seen different incarnations, firstly
a d20 dragonlance MUD called Gates of Krynn, which was scrapped.  The code for that
MUD was donated to Zizazat of CWG (Circle with Goodies... http://cwg.lazuras.org) who
used parts of it to develop his d20 codebase, CWG Rasputin, which in turn we used again
as the base for this codebase in 2005.

The idea of this game is simple.  We wish to cater to a certain niche of MUD players out
there.  First, we obviously are trying to attract fans of the d20 System, D&&D 3.5e
and Pathfinder RPG.  Second, we wish to attract a certain type of player, or rather
avoid a certain type of player, that being the 'trouble maker'.

Essentially our goal is to provide our players with both an original and feature-
rich OGL rules game and a positive and friendly community in which they can feel
at home and relaxed within.  We have established rules, that, perhaps to some may
seem harsh, but which are done, not with the intention of policing our players, but
to weed out those who would have caused issues for our community to begin with, and
to develop a certain sub-culture within our community that generally revolves around
treating each other with respect, courtesy and kindness out of character.

If all of this sounds like something you can sink your teeth in, then by all means,
continue on with us.  We are very happy to have you with us :)  Because the game is
so unique, every player will experience a steep learning curve to some extent, however
we are confident that those who make it over the hump, will have found a game and
community like no other out there in the MUD world.

Thanks for joining.  Here's to many adventures and escapades together :)

TICK PULSE
Ticks on Age of Dragons

A tick is a measure of time by which many things in this game are based
upon, including resting, memorizing spells, spell durations, and so on.

The time for one tick on Age of Dragons is approximately 90 seconds.

This equates to 1 hour in game time.  Thus 24 hours in game time would be
24 * 90 = 2160 secs / 60 seconds/minute = 36 minutes.

BUGS

Bugs are a natural part of any game, especially one that has continued development.
However with bugs comes exploits and loopholes.  Since the mud is currently in beta
there will be even more exploits and loopholes.

It is your solemn responsability as a player to report bugs when you find them.  Do
not tell them to staff members.  Firstly, we will not always remember them.  Secondly
we are, at this stage of the game, here to work on and expand the mud, and the
fewer interruptions we have the better.  We are always happy to answer newbie related
questions, but appreciate it greatly when players take the initiative to be as
independant as possible, such as using the bug command to submit bugs (or the idea
command to submit ideas).  An immortal who is trying to work who gets interrupted
every 20 seconds is likely to get irritated, and may behave accordingly.

So what is a bug?  I don't think this needs definition to anyone who has played any
kind of video game over the years.  A bug is quite simply anything that enhances your
character without you having to do any real work to get it.  Be it experience,
gold, skill points, or anything that enhances your character, any bug that is used
more than once (the first time being the time you noticed it as a bug), will result
in the character being deleted and quite possibly banned.

We, as the staff, have been running these games for a long time and have heard every
excuse in the book, and frankly, we have to patience for them.  You are to do
*everything possible* to avoid repeating a bug.  And you must report it using the
bug command the moment you find it or suspect it of being a bug.  From there leave
it in the hands of a staff member, and check the news frequently to see if the bug has
been fixed.

We have much to do on this game, but our primary focus will be finding and fixing bugs
of already-existing features before adding new ones.  We appreciate your cooperation in
this matter.

--The Staff

Usage: bug <bug report>

This is the syntax for the bug command to report bugs.

Examples:
> bug the entire game crashes when I type 'put bag in bag'



The preferred method of reporting bugs is to report them on the
d20mud.com website wiki page at http://www.d20mud.com/wiki/

SETACTIVE

The Setactive Command:

The setactive command was designed with multiclass spellcasters in mind.  It
allows a character to switch their active class to another class they possess, in
order to memorize spells.

The syntax is as follows:

setactive (no argument)
This will list the classes a character may choose from, preceeded by a number
Ie.
0) Mage
1) Cleric
4) Fighter

If you wanted to switch to fighter, you would then type "setactive 4"

Trip

The Trip Combat Ability:

   The trip combat ability is a combat ability usable by anyone during or before
combat.  Using this ability on someone will initiate combat if it is not
currently underway.  Only those in the first 3 fighting ranks can trip an
opponent.  

A simple trip check is performed as follows:

  Tripping attacker rolls an unarmed attack roll (dodge bonus only to ac, no armor).
If successful he rolls a second d20 trip roll to see if he can trip his opponent.
He adds his strength modifier and +4 for every size rank above medium, or -4 for every
rank below medium.

  The defender rolls a d20 trip defense roll and adds the greatest of his strength modifier
and his dexterity modifier.  If he is stable (ie. a dwarf or minotaur) or he has more than
two legs he add a bonus from +2 to +4.  He adds +4 for every size rank above medium and
-4 for every rank below medium.

  If the attacker's roll is greater than or equal to the defenders, the defender is tripped,
put on his feet, and stunned for one extra round.  If the defender wins the roll, he may attempt
to trip the attacker for free with one try.  If this check fails, nothing happens.

The attacker gets a number of trip attempts equal to his number of attacks, with the
appropriate attack bonus for each rank.  If he has the improved trip feat he receives one
extra trip attempt at maximum attack bonus.  Any unused attacks are not used that round, unless
the character is a monk.

Once tripped a character must use a movement action to stand up again, which will
drop his maximum number of attacks that round to 1.

SKILL-APPRAISE

You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check.  
Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of
its actual value.  Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check
against DC 15, 20, or higher.  If the check is successful, you estimate the
value correctly failure means you cannot estimate the items value.  

A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchants scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weig
These bonuses stack

Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions). 

Special
A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal). 
The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks. 
A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks. 
Synergy
If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that Craft skill

Untrained
For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For rare items, success means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).

SPELL-LESSER-GLOBE-OF-INVULNERABILITY
Note: For General Ability information see: help ABILITIES-ABILITY


Lesser Globe of Invulnerability
Abjuration
Level: Sor/Wiz 4
Usage: cast 'lesser globe of invulnerability' <target>
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: 10 ft.
Area: 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or
lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the lesser globe of invulnerability.
Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities
and spells or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the
magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect
when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an area
dispel magic. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.

Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely
suppressed, not dispelled.


If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level
appropriate to the caster to determine whether lesser globe of invulnerability stops it.

Material Component: A glass or crystal bead that shatters at the expiration of the spell.

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect: Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text
Spell Resistance: No 

This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that its vapors are yellowish green and 
poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature
with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of
Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).

A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in
the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding ones breath doesnt help, but creatures
immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.

Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.

Figure out the clouds new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell. 

Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

SPELL-ANIMAL-GROWTH
Animal Growth
Transmutation
Level: Drd 5, Rgr 4, Sor/Wiz 5
Usage: cast 'animal growth' <target animal>
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Targets: Up to one animal (Gargantuan or smaller) per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

A number of animals grow to twice their normal size and eight times their normal weight. This alteration 
changes each animals size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size
bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to Dexterity. The
creatures existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animals modifier to
AC and attack rolls and its base damage. The animals space and reach change as appropriate to the new size,
but its speed does not change.

The spell also grants each subject damage reduction 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. If
insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may
make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is
constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by
increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.

Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creatures possession instantly returns to its normal size.
The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

"SPELL BALEFUL POLYMORPH"
Blaleful Polymorph
Transmutation
Level: Drd 5, Sor/Wiz 5 
Usaeg: cast 'baleful polymorph' <target> <creature to be turned into>
Casting Time: 1 standard action 
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target: One creature 
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates, Will partial; see text
Spell Resistance: Yes 

You change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD (such as a dog, lizard, monkey, or 
toad). The subject takes on all the statistics and special abilities of an average member of the new form in
place of its own except as follows:

The target retains its own alignment (and personality, within the limits of the new forms ability scores). 
The target retains its own hit points.
The target is treated has having its normal Hit Dice for purpose of adjudicating effects based on HD, such as
the sleep spell, though it uses the new forms base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and all other statistics
derived from Hit Dice.
The target also retains the ability to understand (but not to speak) the languages it understood in its
original form. It can write in the languages it understands, but only the form is capable of writing in some
manner (such as drawing in the dirt with a paw).
With those exceptions, the targets normal game statistics are replaced by those of the new form. The target
oses all the special abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features.

All items worn or carried by the subject fall to the ground at its feet, even if they could be worn or carried by the new form.

If the new form would prove fatal to the creature (for example, if you polymorphed a landbound target into a fish, or an airborne target into a toad), the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.

If the subject remains in the new form for 24 consecutive hours, it must attempt a Will save. If this save
fails, it loses its ability to understand language, as well as all other memories of its previous form, and its
Hit Dice and hit points change to match an average creature of its new form. These abilities and statistics
return to normal if the effect is later ended.

Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to baleful polymorph, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype
(such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its natural form as a standard action (which ends the
spells effect).

"SPELL PASSWALL"

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials.
The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th,
20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the walls thickness is more than the depth
of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells
can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within the passage
are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the passwall or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage
are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one. 

Material Component: A pinch of sesame seeds.

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)
Spell Resistance: No

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a mage armor spell, providing a +4 armor
bonus to AC.

Unlike mundane armor, mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed
reduction. Since mage armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures cant bypass it the way they do normal
armor.

Focus: A piece of cured leather

"SPELL SLEEP"
Sleep
Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Saving Throw: Will negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first

Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spells point of origin are affected first. Hit 
Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).

Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

Material Component: A pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live cricket.

Duration: Instantaneous 
Saving Throw: Will half
Spell Resistance: Yes

When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage +1 point per

rather than harming it.

Duration: 1 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do
not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness 
effect functions normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have
any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire can be blue,
green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to
the objects or creatures thus outlined.

"SPELL SUMMON MONSTER I"
Summon Monster I
Conjuration (Summoning)
Level: Brd 1, Clr 1, Sor/Wiz 1

Casting Time: 1 round
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect: One summoned creature
Duration: 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No 

This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to 
another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to
the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack
particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying Summon Monster table. You
choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or
planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them.

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature,
it is a spell of that type.

Arcane Focus: A tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) candle.

"SPELL INVISIBILITY"
Invisibility
Illusion (Glamour)
Level: Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2, Trickery 2
Usage: cast 'invisibility' <targeT>
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Personal or touch
Target: You or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lb./level
Duration: 1 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)
Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless) or Yes (harmless, object)

The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient
is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your
allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the
clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light
can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the
subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient
detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of
this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who
is a foe depends on the invisible characters perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break
the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb
stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the
bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks
directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that
specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their
area.

Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.

Arcane Material Component: An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

familiars. Almost any creature of the same general size and power as those on the list makes
a suitable familiar. Nor is the masters alignment  the only possible categorization. For

nonlethal damage while grappling.

FEAT-ITEM-CREATION-FEATS
Item Creation Feats

An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless
of the type of items they involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features 
in common. 

XP Cost

Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a magic item. 
The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so
much XP on an item that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a 
new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the 
XP to advance a level. 

Raw Materials Cost

The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item. 
Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, 
special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless 
unusual circumstances apply. 

Time

The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum 
time is one day. 

Item Cost

Brew Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell
effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level-that is, a spell from 
such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price 
of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the 
caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item 
can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster
level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below: 

Scrolls: Base price = spell level * caster level * 25 gp.
Potions: Base price = spell level * caster level * 50 gp.
Wands: Base price = spell level * caster level * 750 gp.

A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation. 

Extra Costs

Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP 
cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the 
material component or pay the XP cost when creating the item. 

For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty 
times the XP cost. 
Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their
descriptions. 
#0
FEAT-LEADERSHIP
Leadership [General]

Prerequisite

Character level 6th. 

Benefit

Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist her.

A character's Leadership Score and outside factors can affect a character's leadership. The
character's reputation, how it treats cohorts/followers, if the character has caused the death of
a follower. A characters base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier.

Several factors can affect a characters Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base
score (character level + Cha modifier). A characters reputation (from the point of view of the cohort 
or follower he is trying to attract) raises or lowers his Leadership score.

See: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#leadership for more detailed information on the Leadership Feat,

FEAT-MANYSHOT
Manyshot [General]

Prerequisites

Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, base attack bonus +6 

Benefit

As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both 
arrows use the same attack roll(with a -4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage 
normally (but see Special).

For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you may add one additional
arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However,
each arrow after the second adds a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll (for a total 
penalty of -6 for three arrows and -8 for four). 

Damage reduction  and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired. 

Special

Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If
you score a critical hit, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal 
regular damage. 

A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats. 

A 6th-level ranger  who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Manyshot 
even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no

#0
FEAT-MAXIMIZE-SPELL
Maximize Spell [Metamagic]

Prerequisite

None

Benefit

All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving 
throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A 
maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spells actual level. 
An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result
plus one-half the normally rolled result. 

#0
FEAT-METAMAGIC-FEATS

Metamagic Feats

Metamagic feats are used to enhance spells cast.  There are several different
feats available, though only the following are currently implemented:

extend spell
maximize spell

For more information on a specific metamagic feat type 'help feat <feat name>'.
For example, type 'help feat extend spell'.

To activate a metamagic feat, type metamagic <first word in the feat name>.
For example 'metamagic extend'.  This will activate this metamagic feat and
all spells cast from there on will be cast with that metamagic feat's effect.
You can type the same command again to toggle it off, and you can have more
than one metamagic feat active at a time.

Different metamagic feats use up different amounts of metamagic points.
Once your metamagic points become less than is needed to use your metamagic
feats, your metamagic feats are automatically turned off.

#0
FEAT-METAMAGIC-FEATS-TWO

A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell can cast a metamagic version of it 
instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a 1-action metamagic spell 
spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra 
full-round action to cast. 

In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared
and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated 
otherwise in the feat description. The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells 
cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster cant use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being
cast from a wand, scroll, or other device. Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell
dont eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However,
casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Metamagic
feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a 
particular feat cant modify.

A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are 
cumulative. You cant apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell. 

With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion,
or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spells higher spell level (after the 
application of the metamagic feat). A character doesnt need the metamagic feat to activate an item 
storing a metamagic version of a spell. 


Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to 
counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell. 
#0
FEAT-MOBILITY
Mobility [General]

Prerequisites

Dex 13, Dodge

Benefit

FEAT-MOUNTED-ARCHERY

Prerequisite

Class if its higher than the mounts regular AC.) 

Special

A fighter may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats. 

#0
FEAT-NATURAL-SPELL
Natural Spell [General]

Prerequisites

Prerequisite

Base attack bonus +1

Benefit

may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow). 

Normal

#0
FEAT-QUICKEN-SPELL
Quicken Spell [Metamagic]

Prerequisite

None

Benefit

quickened spell per round. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full round action
cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the 
spells actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesnt provoke an attack of opportunity.

Special

This feat cant be applied to any spell cast spontaneously (including sorcerer spells, bard
spells, and cleric or druid spells cast spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a 
spontaneously cast spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.

#0

Prerequisite

Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen)

Benefit

light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could
attack if you were using a bow. 

Normal

A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a 
full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow. 

Special

You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new

Prerequisites

Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8

CLASS-BARD

 @nBards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition rather than tradition or
 law. The spontaneous talent, magic, and lifestyle of the bard are incompatible
 with a lawful alignment.

@YBard Class Features@n
 Alignment:       Any nonlawful
 Hit Die:         d6
 Primary Stat:    Charisma (Spellcasting and Bardic Music)
 Secondary Stats: Dexterity and Intelligence are important for many of the bards
                   class skills.

@YSpells@n
 A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast
 any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell,
 a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
 Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bards spell is
 10 + the spell level + the bards Charisma modifier.

 A bard spontaneously casts spells using the @Ysing@n command.
 Ex: sing 'charm person' <target>

 A bard can see which spells he knows by using the @Yspells@n command.

@YBardic Music@n
 Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical
 effects on those around  him (usually including himself, if desired). Each ability
 requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform
@n skill to qualify. If a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least
 one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the
 needed ranks.

 A bard performs using the @Ymusic@n command.
 Ex: music 'inspire courage'

abilities attributes stats statistics
@nAbilities are a set of attributes that help determine your 
aptitude in various areas.  They are @YStrength@n, @YDexterity@n, 
@YConstitution@n, @YWisdom@n, @YIntelligence@n and @YCharisma@n. 
 
@YAbility Modifiers@n
Each ability, after changes made because of 
race, has a modifier ranging from -5 to +5. 
For a table on Ability Modifiers and Bonus spells, see: 
@Whttp://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#tableAbilityModifiersandBonusSpells@n 
 
The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your 
character tries to do something related to that ability. You 
also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't die rolls. 
A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier 
is called a penalty. 
 
@YAbilities and Spellcasters@n 
The ability that governs @YBONUS SPELLS@n depends on what type 
of spellcaster your character is: 
@YIntelligence@n for wizards.  @YWisdom@n for clerics, druids, 
paladins, and rangers.  @YCharisma@n for sorcerers and bards. 
In addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster 
must be of high enough class level to be able to cast spells 
of a given spell level.  The concentration skill is vital to
all sorts of casters, and its key ability is @YConstitution@n 
 
@YThe Abilities@n 
Each ability partially describes your character, 
and affects some of his or her actions. 
 
For more information before creating a character, see: 
@Whttp://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm@n
 
@YStrength@n (Str)@n 
@YStrength@n measures your character's muscle and physical power. 
This ability is especially important for fighters, barbarians, 
paladins, rangers and monks because it helps them prevail in 
combat. @YStrength@n also limits the amount of equipment your 
character can carry. 
 
@YDexterity@n (Dex)@n
@YDexterity@n measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes,
and balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues,
but its also high on the list for characters who typically wear
light or medium armor (rangers and barbarians) or no armor at
all (monks, wizards and sorcerers), and for anyone who wants
to be a skilled archer. 
 
@YConstitution@n (Con)@n 
@YConstitution@n represents your character's health and stamina. 
A @YConstitution@n bonus increases a character's hit points, so 
the ability is important for all classes. Concentration is a 
skill which is important to spellcasters, and its key ability 
is @YConstitution@n.  The lower your @YConstitution@n or Concentration, 
the greater the chance of losing concentration casting a spell. 
 
@YIntelligence@n (Int)@n 
@YIntelligence@n determines how well your character learns and 
reasons. This ability is important for wizards because it 
affects how many spells they can cast, how hard their spells 
are to resist, and how powerful their spells can be. It is 
also important for any character who wants to have a wide 
assortment of skills. 
@W(**Note: An animal has an @YIntelligence@W score of 1 or 2.  
A creature of human-like @YIntelligence@W has a score of at least 3.)@n
 
@YWisdom@n (Wis)@n 
@YWisdom@n describes a characters willpower, common sense, perception, 
and intuition. While @YIntelligence@n represents ones ability to analyze 
information, @YWisdom@n represents being in tune with and aware of one's 
surroundings. @YWisdom@n is the most important ability for clerics and 
druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you 
want your character to have acute senses, put a higher than average 
score in @YWisdom@n. Every creature has a @YWisdom@n score. 
 
@YCharisma@n (Cha)@n 
@YCharisma@n measures a characters force of personality, persuasiveness, 
personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. 
This ability represents actual @YStrength@n of personality, not merely 
how one is perceived by others in a social setting. @YCharisma@n is most 
important for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important 
for clerics, since it affects their ability to turn undead. 
Every creature has a @YCharisma@n score. 
@W(***Note: When an ability score changes, all attributes associated 
with that score change accordingly.  A character does not retroactively 
get additional skill points for previous levels if she increases her @YIntelligence@W.)@n

CLASS-ABILITIES-COUNTERSONG
Countersong (Su)

A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter 
magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components).
Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the 
bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical
attack may use the bards Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the 
saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within 
range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or 
language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each 
round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bards Perform check result for the 
save. Countersong has no effect against effects that dont allow saves. The bard may keep up
the countersong for 10 rounds. 

#0
CLASS-ABLITIIES-FASCINATE
Fascinate (Sp)

A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or
more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within
90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also 
be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents 
the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target 
one additional creature with a single use of this ability. 

To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each 
affected creatures Will save against the effect. If a creatures saving throw succeeds, 
the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw 
fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as 
long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard 
level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, 
such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another 
Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new 
Perform check result. 

Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged 
weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment 
(compulsion), mind-affecting ability. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-INSPIRE-COURAGE
Inspire Courage (Su)

A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in
his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat 
abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for 
as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally 
receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale 
bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, 
this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a 
mind-affecting ability. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-INSPIRE-COMPETENCE
Inspire Competence (Su)

A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or 
poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see 
and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally. 

The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or
she continues to hear the bards music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The 
effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard cant 
inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-SUGGESTION
Suggestion (Sp)

A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion
(as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated. Using this ability does not 
break the bards concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving
throw against the fascinate effect. 

Making a suggestion doesnt count against a bards daily limit on bardic music performances. 
A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bards level + bards Cha modifier) negates the effect. This 
ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an 
enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-INSPIRE-GREATNESS
Inspire Greatness (Su)

A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or 
poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting 
him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he 
can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three 
at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him 
sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds 
thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the 
commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the targets Constitution modifier, if 
any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence 
bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the 
effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-SONG-OF-FREEDOM
Song of Freedom (Sp)

A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or 
poetics to create an effect equivalent to the break enchantment spell (caster level equals 
the characters bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted 
concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard cant 
use song of freedom on himself. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-INSPIRE-HEROICS
Inspire Heroics (Su)

A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or 
poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. 
For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one 
additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard 
sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a 
+4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 
up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-MASS-SUGGESTION
Mass Suggestion (Sp)

This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher 
with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any 
number of creatures that he has already fascinated. Mass suggestion is an enchantment 
(compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

CLASS-BESERKER
Beserker

Alignment: Any Non-Lawful

Either born in the wilds or rejecting the comforttable life of the city life, beserkers are
confused by the complex rules of civilized society and are never truly comfortable behind 
walls. Beserkers are tough resilient survivors. They make fierce combatants and are both 
valued and feard for their prowess in battle.

Religion

Beserkers worship is usually casual, though tribal clerics and druids command respect. 
Beserkers revere the dieties of nature: Habbakuk, Chislev or Zeboim, depending on their
alignment.

Races

Most beserkers in Ansalon are human nomads, Kagonesti elves, or ogres. Almost all other 
races produce occassional beserkers with the exception of the gnomes of Mt. Nevermind. Even 
kender raised in wilder regions have been known to become fierce wilderness warriors.

**Taken from the Dragonlance Campaign setting, with the noted change of class Barbarian,
being named class Beserker to avoid confusion between races of barbarians (nomads) and the 
class.

*Class Skills (and the key ability for each skill)


Climb (Str)              Listen (Wis)
Craft (Int)              Ride (Dex)
Handle Animal (Cha)      Survival (Wis)
Intimidate (Cha)         Swim (Str) 
Jump (Str)

*Note: type help SKILL-<SKILL-NAME> for more information on indvidual skills.

CLASS FEATURES

Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A beserker is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and 
shields (except tower shields). 

Illiteracy

Beserkers are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A 
beserker may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is
able to speak. 

A beserker who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other 
character who gains a beserker level does not lose the literacy he or she already had. 

*Beserker Class Abilities:

Fast Movement (Ex)                 Damage Reduction (Ex)
Rage (Ex)                          Greater Rage (Ex)

Ex-beserkers

A beserker who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a 
beserker. He retains all the other benefits of the class (damage reduction, fast movement, 
trap sense, and uncanny dodge). 

SEE: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm for more information on this class. Age
of Legends renamed the class from Barbarian to Beserker to avoid confusion with the race 
Barbarian (nomads, plainsmen). 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-FAST-MOVEMENT
Fast Movement (Ex)

A character with this class ability land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit
applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply
this bonus before modifying the land speed of a character with this ability because of any load carried
or armor worn.

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-RAGE
Rage (Ex)

A beserker can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a beserker 
temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on 
Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases 
the beserker's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the 
rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost 
first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a beserker cannot use any Charisma-, 
Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and 
Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor
can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such 
as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has 
except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. 

A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) 
Constitution modifier. A beserker may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the 
beserker loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to 
Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current 
encounter (unless he is a 17th-level beserker, at which point this limitation no longer 
applies). 

A beserker can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage 
ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one 
additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage 
takes no time itself, but a beserker can do it only during his action, not in response to 
someone else's action. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-UNCANNY-DODGE
Uncanny Dodge (Ex)

At 2nd level, a character with this ability retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he  
is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus
to AC if immobilized. If a beserker already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically 
gains improved uncanny dodge instead. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-TRAP-SENSE
Trap Sense (Ex)

Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge 
bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels 
thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes 
stack. 

For Dwarven Defender:

At 4th level, a dwarven defender gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 
dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. At 8th level, these bonuses rise to +2. These bonuses 
stack with trap sense bonuses gained from other classes. 

For Rogue:

At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 
bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by 
raps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, 
to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level. Trap sense bonuses gained 
from multiple classes stack. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-VENOM-IMMUNITY
Venom Immunity (Ex)

At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-THOUSAND-FACES
A Thousand Faces (Su)

At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the 
disguise self spell, but only while in her normal form. This affects the druids body but 
not her possessions. It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the 
druids appearance, within the limits described for the spell. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-TIMELESS-BODY
Timeless Body (Ex)

Druid:

After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and 
cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in 
place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.. 


Monk:

Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging
and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain 
in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-WILD-EMPATHY
Wild Empathy (Ex)

Druid:

A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy
check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid 
level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. 

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are 
usually unfriendly. 

To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means
that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, 
influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might 
take more or less time. 

A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score o
1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check. 

Ranger:

A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level 
and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic 
animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means
that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. 
Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing 
people, it might take more or less time. 

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score
of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-COMBAT-STYLE
Combat Style (Ex)

At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon 
combat. This choice affects the character's class features but does not restrict his selection 
of feats or special abilities in any way. 

If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not 
have the normal prerequisites for that feat. 

If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, 
even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. 

The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses 
all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-TURN-OR-REBUKE-UNDEAD
Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su)

Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the
power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol. 

A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead 
creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or 
commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning 
ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it 
cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure 
or inflict spells. 

A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma 
modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning 
checks against undead. 

When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may 
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead 
as a cleric of three levels lower would. 
#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-AURA
Aura (Ex)

A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura 
corresponding to the deity's alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Clerics who 
don't worship a specific deity but choose the Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law domain have a similarly
powerful aura of the corresponding alignment. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-CANNY-DEFENSE
Canny Defense (Ex)

When not wearing armor or using a shield, a duelist adds 1 point of Intelligence bonus (if any)
per duelist class level to her Dexterity bonus to modify Armor Class while wielding a melee 
weapon. If a duelist is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also 
loses this bonus. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-IMPROVED-REACTION
Improved Reaction (Ex)

At 2nd level, a duelist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks.

At 8th level, the bonus increases to +4. This bonus stacks with the benefit provided by the 
Improved Initiative feat. 

#0

Enhanced Mobility (Ex)

When wearing no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an additional +4 bonus to AC 
against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of a threatened square. 

#0

CLASS-ABILITIES-PRECISE-STRIKE
Precise Strike (Ex)

At 5th level, a duelist gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed
piercing weapon, gaining an extra 1d6 damage added to her normal damage roll. 

When making a precise strike, a duelist cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a 
shield. A duelist's precise strike only works against living creatures with discernible 
anatomies. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to a precise strike,
and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature 
from a precise strike. At 10th level, the extra damage on a precise strike increases to +2d6.

#0
CLASS-ABILITES-ACROBATIC-CHARGE
Acrobatic Charge (Ex)

At 6th level, a duelist gains the ability to charge in situations where others cannot. She may
charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement. Depending on the circumstance, she
may still need to make appropriate checks to successfully move over the terrain. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-ELABORATE-PARRY
Elaborate Parry (Ex)

At 7th level and higher, if a duelist chooses to fight defensively or use total defense in 
melee combat, she gains an additional +1 dodge bonus to AC for each level of duelist she has. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-AC-BONUS
AC Bonus (Ex)

Monk:

When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In 
addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five 
monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). 

These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses 
these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a 
shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load. 


Dwarven Defender:

The dwarven defender receives a dodge bonus to Armor Class that starts at +1 and improves as 
the defender gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level.

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-FLURRY-OF-BLOWS
Flurry of Blows (Ex)

When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing 
so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack 
takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round.  This penalty applies for 1 
round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action.
When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A 
monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows. 

When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk 
weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with 
unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part 
of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus  1 or ) to her 
damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The 
monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. 

In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using 
the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may
still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough 
attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-GREATER-FLURRY
Greater Flurry

When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the 
standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at 
her full base attack bonus. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-EVASION
Evasion (Ex)

Monk:

At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that 
normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be 
used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the 
benefit of evastion.


Rogue:

At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.
If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half 
damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue 
is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion. 

Ranger:

At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he 
makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a 
successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing 
light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

SKILL-APPRAISAL
Appraise (Int)

Check

You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that 
you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value. 

Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If 
the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate 
the items value. 

A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that 
is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchants scale gives you a +2 circumstance 
bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made 
of precious metals. 

These bonuses stack. 

Action

Appraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive full-round actions). 

Try Again

No. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success. 

Special

A dwarf gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items 
because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone 
or metal). 

The master of a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks. 

A character with the Diligent feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks. 

Synergy

If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items 
made with that Craft skill. 

Untrained

For common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate. For rare items, success 
means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%).

#0
SKILL-BALANCE
Balance (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)

Check

You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along
the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you cant move for 1 round. A failure by 
5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows: 

Being Attacked while Balancing

You are considered flat-footed while balancing, since you cant move to avoid a blow, and thus 
you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you 
arent considered flat-footed while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must 
make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing. 

Accelerated Movement

You can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 
penalty, you can move your full speed as a move action. (Moving twice your speed in a round 
requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty 
in order to charge across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each 
multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof) that you charge. 

Action

None. A Balance check doesnt require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a 
reaction to a situation. 

Special

If you have the Agile feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks. 

Synergy

If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks. 

#0
SKILL-BLUFF
Bluff (Cha)


Check

A Bluff check is opposed by the targets Sense Motive check. See the accompanying table for 
examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the targets Sense Motive check for 
each one. 

Example Circumstances                                                  Sense Motive Modifier

The target wants to believe you.                                                 -5 
The bluff is believable and doesnt affect the target much.                       +0 
The bluff is a little hard to believe or puts the target at some risk.           +5 
The bluff is hard to believe or puts the target at significant risk.             +10 
The bluff is way out there, almost too incredible to consider.                   +20 

Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two 
circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the 
target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the 
like. If its important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target 
doesnt believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For 
instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands 
something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didnt so 
much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 
or more has seen through the bluff. 

A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short 
time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, 
however, is not a suggestion spell. 

A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be 
bluffed. 


Feinting in Combat

You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it cant dodge your next 
attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your targets Sense Motive check, 
but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other 
applicable modifiers. 

If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your target is 
denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This 
attack must be made on or before your next turn. 

Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because its harder to read a strange 
creatures body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of 
animal Intelligence (1 or 2) its even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent
creature, its impossible. 

Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity. 

Creating a Diversion to Hide

You can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary 
diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not 
provoke an attack of opportunity. 

Delivering a Secret Message

You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. 
The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on 
getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you cant get the message across. 
Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone 
listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you made to 
transmit in order to intercept your message (see Sense Motive). 

Action

Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is 
at least a full-round action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A 
Bluff check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A Bluff 
check made to deliver a secret message doesnt take an action; it is part of normal 
communication. 

Try Again

Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious 
for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made 
to feint in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may 
attempt such a retry only once per round. 

Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication. 

Special

A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy. 

The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks. 

If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks. 


Synergy

If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight 
of Hand checks, as well as on Disguise checks made when you know youre being observed and you 
try to act in character.

SKILL-CLIMB

See: SKILL ATHLETICS
#0
SKILL-CONCENTRATION

Usage: Automatic

The concentration skill is used to counter the effects of taking
damage while casting spells.  Every round, the total damage you take
is compared against your concentration roll.  If your concentration
roll is higher than the damage you take, you successfully cast the
spell, otherwise it fails.

The combat casting feat increases concentration by +4 when casting
spells in combat.

Concentration is modified by a character constitution ability modifier.

SKILL-DECIPHER-SCRIPT


Decipher Script was not deemed to be useful enough nor easy
enough to implement given its usefulness, to implement.  If
you have any ideas on how decipher script can be used and
coded in the mud please post them on the forums, and they

#0
SKILL-DIPLOMACY
Diplomacy (Cha)

Check

Diplomacy is used mostly in role played situations, but is also used in
various ways in the coded game as well.  Diplomacy for example affects
your success with bartering and the haggle command.  It also affects
ones ability to lead powerful npcs, through use of the callset command
when choosing henchmen.

Special

A half-elf has a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks.
Diplomacy is required for the @Ycombat challenge@n series of feats.
If you have the Negotiator feat, you get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

Synergy

If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff or Lore you get a +2 bonus on 
Diplomacy checks. 
#0
SKILL-DISABLE-DEVICE

Usage: disable <item | direction>

The disable device skill is used to disarm traps located on
exits or containers.  A successful use will result in the disarming
of the trap.  A critical success will result in the salvaging of
the trap for future use.  A critical miss will result in the setting
off of the trap much to the dismay of all in the room.

Try Again

Varies. You can retry if you have missed the check by 4 or
less, though you must be aware that you have failed in order 
to try again.

Special

If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus on 

Disable Device checks.

A rogue who beats a traps DC by 10 or more can study the trap, 
figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her companions)
without disarming it.

Restriction

Rogues (and other characters with the trapfinding class feature) 
can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + 
the spell level of the magic used to create it. 
#0
SKILL-DISGUISE

Disguise (Cha)

Usage: disguise <desc1|desc2> <race|sex|eyes|nose|ears|face|scar|hair|build|complexion> <list|# in list>\

To finish a disguise and make it active type 'disguise finish'.
To remove a disguise type 'disguise remove'.

To set my disguise to be a male orc with blue eyes I would type:
disguise desc1 race 93
disguise desc1 eyes 1
disguise finish

Disguise is opposed by the spot skill.

Intros are not active unless the person is either grouped with the disguised, or succeeds
at a spot vs disguise check.

If a spot check succeeds, they will see the real desc along with the fact that they are
disguised.

Changing race imposes a -2 penalty.  Changing sex is another -2.  They stack.

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-FAVORED-ENEMY
Favored Enemy (Ex)

At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Ranger 
Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival
checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on 
weapon damage rolls against such creatures. 

Table: Ranger Favored Enemies 

Type (Subtype)                  Type (Subtype) 

Aberration                     Humanoid (reptilian)
Animal                         Magical beast 
Construct                      Monstrous Humanoid 
Dragon                         Ooze 
Elemental                      Outsider (air) 
Fey                            Outsider (chaotic) 
Giant                          Outsider (earth) 
Humanoid (aquatic)             Outsider (evil) 
Humanoid (dwarf)               Outsider (fire) 
Humanoid (elf)                 Outsider (good) 
Humanoid (goblinoid)           Outsider (lawful) 
Humanoid (gnoll)               Outsider (native) 
Humanoid (gnome)               Outsider (water) 
Humanoid (halfling)            Plant 
Humanoid (human)               Undead 
Humanoid (orc)                 Vermin   

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may 
select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such 
interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so 
desired) increases by 2. 


If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an 
associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one 
category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is 
higher. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-WOODLAND-STRIDE
Woodland Stride (Ex)

Druid:

Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural 
thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking 
damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that 
have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her. 

Ranger:

Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural 
thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking 
damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are 
enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-SWIFT-TRACKER
Swift Tracker (Ex)

Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without 
taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when 
moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-IMPROVED-EVASION
Improved Evasion (Ex)

Monk:

At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful 
Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed 
save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. 

Rogue:

This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a 
successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she takes only half damage on a 
failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-OPPORTUNIST
Opportunist (Ex)

Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just 
been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue's attack 
of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the 
opportunist ability more than once per round. 


#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-SKILL-MASTERY
Skill Mastery

The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even 
under adverse conditions. 

Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence 
modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress 
d distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special 
ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-SLIPPERY-MIND
Slippery Mind (Ex)

This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would 
otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment 
spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same 
DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-DIAMOND-BODY
Diamond Body (Su)

At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-ABUNDANT-STEP
Abundant Step (Su)

At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell 
dimension door, once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level 
(rounded down). 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-DIAMOND-SOUL
Diamond Soul (Ex)

At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to 
affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + 
caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-QUIVERING-PALM
Quivering Palm (Su)

Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that 
can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a 
week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, 
plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be 
affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the 
blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any 
later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To 
make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the 
target makes a Fortitude saving throw  (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), 
it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that 
particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.


#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-TONGUE-OF-THE-SUN-AND-MOON
Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)

A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-EMPTY-BODY
Empty Body (Su)

At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level 
per day, as though using the spell etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different 
occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal 
state does not exceed her monk level. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-COMBAT-STYLE-MASTERY
Combat Style Mastery (Ex)

At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) 
improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved 
Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. 

If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater 
Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. 

As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no 
armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-TRACKLESS-STEP
Trackless Step (Ex)

Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.
She may choose to leave a trail if so desired. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-RESIST-NATURES-LURE
Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)

Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like 
abilities of fey. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-WILD-SHAPE
Wild Shape (Su)

At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and 
back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. 
This ability functions like the alternate form special ability, except as noted here. The 
effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or 
back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Each time you use wild 
shape, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night. 

Any gear worn or carried by the druid melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When 
the druid reverts to her true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in 
the same location on her body that they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any 
new items worn in the assumed form fall off and land at the druid's feet. 

The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. 

A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds 
that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals 
of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a 
squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.) 

A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.
In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny 
animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level. 

The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level. 

At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the 
same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of
a plant that isn't a creature.) 

At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large 
elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to 
her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains 
all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the 
elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature 
type. 

At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level 
she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to 
change into a Huge elemental. 

#0
CLASS-ABILITIES-ANIMAL-COMPANION
Animal Companion (Ex)

A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: 

badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake
(Small or Medium viper), or wolf. 

If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures
are also available: 

manta ray, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. 

This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate 
for its kind. 

A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as at:
http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#theDruidsAnimalCompanion


As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on the above webpage.
If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony
If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremon
requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion 
that has perished. 



A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals. Should she select 
an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the
character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the 
appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid 
level entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would
reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.) 

Ranger: 

This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger's 
effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative 
lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half 
his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice 
would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.

STAFF-APPLICATIONS STAFF-POSITIONS IMMORTAL_APPLICATIONS IMMORTAL-POSITIONS
@n
If you are interested in working for our mud, can maintain builder's academy building
standards, and are a friendly, positive minded person who doesn't view players as needed to
be policed and who likes others in general and by default, then please feel free to send us
an email.  All applications can currently be sent to stephen.squires@gmail.com.

In your application please copy and paste the following questions and answer them as best you
can:

1) What position are you applying for? (you can do more than one thing)

2) Are you willing and able to follow builder's academy building guidelines and include at 
least 2 scripted quests in each 100 room zone you create?

3) Are you willing to abide by all player and staff policies and to be a positive and good 
role model for our players?

4) Do you view players as needing to be policed or do you feel that basically whatever happens
in mortal world is for mortals to handle as long as no policies are broken?

5) Do you believe that staff should actively search for infractions in policies or do you think
they should wait until an issue comes to their attention some other way?

6) What is your knowledge of DnD 3.5e rules?  (This is for our purposes and is not a decisive 
factor in determining if you will be accepted)

7) What is your knowledge of Post War of the Souls Dragonlance Theme?  (This is for our purposes
and is not a decisive factor in determining if you will be accepted)

8) Are you a positive minded person that likes others by default and generally seeks to avoid
contention rather than embrace or look for it?

9) Can you admit when you're wrong (even to players)?  Can you forgive others easily when they 
make mistakes or offend you?

10) How much influence do you expect to have on the decision making processes of the mud and 
why do you feel you deserve such influence? (This is for our purposes and is not a decisive 
factor in determining if you will be accepted)

11) Who is your favorite Dragonlance character and why?  (if, and only if, you don't know 
dragonlance, choose another fictional theme)

I realise that's a rather lengthy application but it helps make us sure of two things.  1) 
That you are serious and 2) that you would be a good fit for our team and our project goals.

well.

extra experience, extra money, unique items, and other special perks.

money or through any other method.

-Steel coins (1000 steel coins per credit)
-Experience (1000 experience points per credit)
-Player House (10 credits)
-Extra room on your player house (8 credits)
-yourname@@ageofmortalsmud.com email address hosted by gmail (20 credits)
-Unique, reimbursable item, you must provide the descs and desired stats (1 credit per 2 
item levels, round up, min 5 credits)
-Non-reimbursable item restring, you must provide the descs (1 credit)
-Reimbursable item restring, you must provide the descs(3 credits)
-Title change, you must be eligable for the title... knights of neraka cannot have knights 
of solamnia titles (1 credit)
-Character descriptions reset (5 credits)
-Character respec (10 credits)
-Create new character with advanced race (depends on race, starts at 20 credits)

We welcome additional ideas for credit rewards, though the final say
on what they cost will be up to the administration.

head administrator.  Tools are coming soon so you can redeem your credits
yourself for certain items.

Some rewards can be gained automatically.  use the spendcredits command to view
and redeem these rewards with your credits.

RULES-DISCLAIMER

@RWE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO DEAL WITH SITUATIONS AS WE SEE FIT@n

Please note that this is not a comprehensive list of everything you are not
allowed to do here.  We cannot foresee every situation, and even if we could,
it is not reasonable to expect players to read and remember 10 pages of rules.
As such, a certain amount of responsability falls upon you, the player to
play and behave responsibly.  Additionally, a certain amount of freedom is
given to our staff to deal with situations according to their own judgement
and conscience.  Mouthing off to an imm over a rule dispute is not acceptable
and it will get you deleted or banned.  Simply put, you do not bite the hand
that feeds you, and if you do, you can expect to be put down.  My apologies for
this harshness to all of the players out there who play and behave responsibly
and respectfully.

This chance is rolled every time the weapon dice are rolled.  So for normal hits 
and once per critical multiplier for critical hits.

monetary gain involved.

Crafting generally takes place in two phases.  First is the harvesting
of resources.  For more information on harvesting resources type @Yhelp
harvesting@n.  The next step is crafting the item.  For more information
on crafting items type @Yhelp crafting items@n.

Crafting takes place using different skills.  Either a harvesting skill
to obtain the resources, or a crafting skill to make the item.

Harvesting Skills:
@WHerbalism@n: Used for gaining herbs for use in alchemy to make potions,
salves, and magical essences.
@WFarming@n: Used for gaining food resources for use in creating food and
drink buffs.
@WHunting@n: Hunting is used to find minor food in the wilderness,
the skinning of animals, and also the collection of lumber for
use in woodworking.

the blacksmithing and goldsmithing crafts.

Crafting Skills:

and belts.
@WGoldsmithing@n: Used to make rings, necklaces, bracers and other jewelry and

cook --> cooking, assemble --> woodworking, tan --> tanning,
craft --> goldsmithing, forge --> blacksmithing, gather --> herbalism,
harvest --> farming, hunt --> hunting, mine --> mining.

Harvesting is the means of gathering resources for the purpose
of crafting items.  In order to successfully harvest something you
must be in a room that provides the resources.  For example, if you
want to mine ore, you must go to a mountain or cave where there is
ore to mine.  It is up to you to find which rooms these are.

You begin harvesting by typing the harvesting command.  Then, after
a certain amount of time, generally 2 minutes for most classes and
less for higher level artisans, you will either succeed or fail
depending on your skill in that type of harvesting, and the richness
of the resource deposit in the room.

Each room can be harvested a maximum of 5 times per 20 minute cycle,
after which the room resets and can be harvested another 5 times.

CRAFTING-ITEMS

  Crafting items is done once you have the resources needed to
create the item.  You can see what items you can craft by typing
your craft command and list.  So to see what items I can forge I
would type forge list.  You can see what components each item needs
by typing listcomponents and the item description.  So if I wanted
to see what items I need to craft a steel kukri, I would type
listcomponents a steel kukri.

In general they higher the level of your crafting skill, the more
powerful items you can create.

Once the crafting process has begun all resources will be extracted.
Then 2 minutes later, or less for artisans, you will make a skill
check.  If successful the item will be given to you.  If failed you
will lose the item and your resources.

Artisans gain experience for crafting items.  Regular classes do not.

HALF-ELF

  Half elves are the result of an inter-racial union between
humans and elves.  Their appearance can vary widely between the
origins of their parents, but generally they all have the
pointed ears of their elven parent and the stockier frame
and beard (if male) of their human parent.

Half elves use their highest class as their favored class.
They are medium sized humanoids with a base land speed of
30.  They are immune to sleep effects and gain a +2 saving
throw bonus against enchantment effects.  They have low light
vision, and gain a +1 to skill checks for listen, spot, and
search.  They also gain a +2 bonus to skill checks for diplomacy
and gather information.  They are considered to be of the racial
group elves due to their dominant elven blood.

Their automatic languages are common and elven.

RACE-NORTHERNERS

  Northerners are humans hailing from the Northern Sword Coast,
Silver Marches and Ice Wind Dale.  The ice barbarians of icewind
dale and the spine of the world are considered a race of their own.
Northerners are a stoic lot, having endured harsh climates and 
harsh winters at best.  The north is a very competitive area for
trade, and the trait has passed on to most Northerners.  They
are known, for the most part, to be welcoming of strangers however,
for the potential economic boosts they can bring to their area.
Northerners have dealt with much hardship from orcs, and so many
have a steadfast hatred for them.  Others see the new orcish
civilization of Many-Arrows as a potential blessing and end to
the centuries of orc raids and war.

As humans, northerners get one additional skill point each level,
and four more at level one.  They start off with an additional
feat to choose from, and always use their highest class as their
favored class.  Northerners can speak common and chondathan
automatically.

ICE-BARBARIAN

  Ice barbarians are the nomad folk who live in the wilds of
Icewind Dale and the Spine of the World.  They are considered
barbaric by the civilized races, and value strength and wisdom
in their societies.  Often their chieftain is the greatest
warrior.  They almost always worship Tempus as one of their
chief gods, and thus are warlike in nature and often raiding
each other's villages and clans.  Each tribe follows after
a specific animal, which is their totem spirit, for example
the Tribe of th Elk or the Tribe of the Bear.

Ice Barbarians are humans and thus they receive one extra
feat at level one, plus one extra skill point each level and
four extra skill points at level one.  Their highest class is
always their favored class.  Ice Barbarians are slightly stronger
than other humans, and slightly less charismatic.  They speak
common and their own ice barbarian languages by default.

CORMYRIAN

  Cormyrians hail from the kingdom of Cormyr southeast of the
Aunorach Desert, North of Sembia and south of the Dalelands.
Cormyrians have had a long standing fued with Sembia and have
even gone to war a couple of times.  Their king is the famed
King Azoun, and they are well known for their noble knightly
order, the Purple Dragon Knights.  They are a noble and civilized
people who believe in chivalry and etiquette.

Cormyrians, being humans, gain one extra feat at level one, and
also gain one extra skill point each level plus four extra skill
points at level one.  Their highest class is always considered their
favored class.  They are slightly less hardy than other humans and
are slightly more charismatic.  They speak common and chondathan
by default.

AMNITE

Amnites are known for being a nation of merchants, thieves and corrupt leaders.
They are commonly known as worshippers of Bane and Cyric, as well as the dieties
of industry, profit, and luck.  The shadow thieves have their hands in all aspects
of their society, and they are ruled by a corrupt group known as the Council of Six.
Divine spellcasters are widely revered in Amn assuming they can generate profit.
Arcane spellcasters are universally despised.  Amn has a strong domination over the
tropical island known as Maztica.  They have also struggled with monstrous humanoids
as two ogre mages have taken over much of southern Amn with their armies.  As a result
their tolerance, for orcs, ogres, giants and goblinkind is less than favorable.

Amnites, being humans, gain one extra feat at level one and one extra skill point
each level plus four extra skill points at level one.  Their highest class is always
considered their favored class.  They are more dextrous and less charismatic than
most other races, despite their excellent abilities as merchants.

Amnites speak common and chondathan by default.

ACCOUNT-EXPERIENCE

Account experience is used to unlock special features in the game such as
advanced races and prestige classes.  The main method of gaining account
experience is through role playing.  The second main method of gaining it
is by contributing content to the game, such as zones, socials, help files
and so forth.
 
You can spend your account experience with the @Yaccexp@n command.  Once
spent account experience is gone forever, but the feature unlocked is then
available for every character on your account and all future characters,

RULES-NAMES

@RORIGINAL FANTASY-BASED NAMES ONLY PLEASE@n

1) No modern names.  If a name wasn't in popular use in medieval times
then it is not acceptable.  For example Alexander would be acceptable
whereas Betsy would not be.

No names from existing fictional works.  That includes Dragonlance
characters.  Do not use names from novels, movies, comics, or what have you.
Please be original with your names.

3) No modern day nouns as names.  It's ok to call your character something
like Scimitar or Knife, because these are possible nicknames people from
the underworld might call themselves or each other.  However in such circumstances
it is expected for you to invent a real name for your character following
these guidelines for role playing purposes.  It would not be acceptable to
call your character Bazooka or Bomber because Bazookas and Bombs don't
exist in a medieval setting.

4) No compound names.  Depending on your race, please do not use compound
names, such as madkiller.  Something like firestar might be acceptable for
a wild elf or a barbarian, because both fire and star are common things in
a medieval fantasy world.  It is thinkable that someone from these cultures
might name their child this.  Madkiller on the other hand is something
no one would name their child, and is unlikely someone would name themselves
either.

In general we ask that you simply make an attempt to use a name that is
original and that make sense in a fantasy medieval world.  If you create
a character with an invalid name you will be asked to change it.  If you
comply with cooperation we will reimburse your character's gear and
levels.  Otherwise we will be forced to unfortunately, delete you.

If you need help choosing a name consider using this name generator:
@Whttp://www.seventhsanctum.com/index-name.php@n

Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  It will help enhance the
role play of the game and the fun for all involved.

ANAUROCHIAN

  The Anauroch Desert is a huge desert wasteland that separates the
east and west halves of Faerun's north.  Once home to the Netheril
and then the Shining Kingdoms, it is now home to a nomadic group
of barbarians known as the Bedine.  The Bedine live by raiding and
leading caravans through the desert.  They are divided into dozens
of different tribes led by shieks whose wealth is measured by the size
and well being of their herds.

As humans, the Anaurochians or Bedine, gain one extra feat at level one
and also one extra skill point each leve, with 4 extra skill points at
level one.  They have hardier constitutions than other humans and
are less charismatic.  They speak common and midani by default.

CHULTAN
The humans of chult live in small tribal villages, moving yearly when the poor soil becomes depleted.  They use weapons that don't require much metal.  Iron and steel are too rare for the Chultans to produce metal armor in any quantity.
Tribal Custom restricts the practice of sorcery and wizardry among the rural clans, although people with an aptitude for magic are as comman in Chult as they are anywhere else.  Only one wielder of arcane magic is permitted in any clan or village.  These

DALESMAN
Although they share common traditions, cultural practices, and
religious allegiances, the Dalelands are not a unified kingdom like Cormy or
Sembia.  They are small and disorganized groups of stubborn, back-woods farmers
and craftsfolk who maintain control of the coveted lands surrounding the great
elven forest.  Dalesfolk rely on their ancient gifts of heroism, self-reliance,
and a strong, almost clannish sense of community.

To outsiders, Dalesfolk seem colse-mouthed, suspicious, and reserved.  
Until newcomers are identified as friends or foes, or vouched for by a trusted

comes from training and discipline, however, the barbarian has a powerful

@YSpells@n

 
A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. 
Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to 
her moral or ethical beliefs. A druid must choose and prepare her 
spells in advance.  
 
To prepare spells the druid needs to use the comman mem like shown below.
 
Ex: mem <spell> or mem <multi-word-spell>
 
To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at 
east 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against 
a druids spell is 10 + the spell level + the druids Wisdom modifier.
 
A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot 
lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place. A druid may prepare 
and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells 
of that level, but she m
st choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.
 
A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if
she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated 
by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.
 
The druid cast spells with the command chant like shown below.
 
Ex: chant '<spell>' target

CUSTOM-CRAFTING-SYSTEM

  The custom crafting system works a little differently than the recipe-based
crafting system.  You are able to create any item at all without having to
refer to a specific recipe.

First you need a crafting station.  They are available in all of the major
cities.  You will need a stock mold item, which can be bought from the mundane
item shops, and you will need enough materials to match the weight of the item
you wish to create, and finally if you wish the item to be magical you will
need magical essences of some type.

To begin put your mold item, your materials and your essences in the crafting
station.  For every 4 essences of the same type you put in the station, the
bonus will increase by +1 (or more depending on the bonus type).  Once you
have your items in the station, you need to use the create command to create
your item.

Type create <item description> to create the item.  The item description is
very important.  You can use color in your item descriptions, but it must
contain the material type and the item type name in the description.  It also
must coincide with the forgotten realms world and be a physical description.

Good Desc:
a shimmering steel long sword with a gem-studded hilt

Bad Descs:
a steel long sword of death
the steel long sword of killing Elvis

We immortals retain the right to take away any item we feel interferes with
the role playing environment without reimbursing the item or materials used
to craft it, so please use good sense when creating your item descriptions.

Once you type create <description> you will begin the crafting process,
assuming your skill is high enough.  After about 2 minutes, you will make
a skill roll.  The more powerful the item the more difficult the dc.  If you
fail you lose the item and all materials.  If you succeed you gain the item
you were crafting.


A couple of final notes:
- The essence must go into the crafting system after everything else
- You can only use one material in your items, though your desc can contain more
- Currently only one essence type will take effect.  If you put in two different
essences in your recipe, only the last one put in will be used.  Essences of
the same type and power are fine, other essences will be lost.
- Don't forget you can mine metals with the mining skill and disenchant magic
items for essences with the spellcraft skill.

CLASS-ARTISAN
@nThe artisan is a class dedicated to the crafting and gathering professions.
Artisans are able to gain experience from gathering materials, and creating
items. This experience, however, is seperate from the class level experience
seen in @Yscore@n or @Ystats@n.  All players start with one artisan level.
@n
By typing @Yartisan@n, you can see your current artisan skill levels, the cost
to increase them, and your current artisan experience and artisan level. Artisan
experience is more like a currency than anything else. Spending XP can be used
to gain levels in the Artisan class, or to raise skills. Its all up to you as
to how many artisan skills you want to grow before gaining an artisan class
level. Artisan class levels also sometimes award specific feats for that level.
@n
To increase a skill, simply type @Ypractice <skillname>@n
@n
To gain an Artisan level, type @Ygain artisan@n

Also, see @Yhelp custom crafting@n for information on crafting custom items.

RACE-TIEFLING
@nTwisted, devious, and untrustworthy, tieflings more often than not follow their
inherernt tendencies and heed the call to evil. A few defy their nature, but
still must fight against popular opinion (if their nature is known) or the
feeling of otherworldly "wrongness" that seems to follow them wherever they go.
@n
Aside from a demeanor that many find disturbing, many tiefligns are indistingu-
ishable from humans. Others have small horns, pointed teeth, red eyes, a whiff
of brimstone about them, or even cloven feet. No two tieflings are the same.
@n
In most human societies, tieflings maintain a low profile, operating as thieves,
assassins, or spies. Occasionally one rises to a position of power, but when its
nature is revealed it can sometimes quickly become an outcast.

@nAs polymorph,except that you change the subject into a Small or smaller animal
@nof no more than 1 HD.If the new form would prove fatal to the creature the
@nsubject gets a +4 bonus on the save. If the spell succeeds, the subject must
also make a Will save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its 
extraordinary, @nsupernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to
cast spells (if it had the ability),and gains the alignment, special abilities,
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own.
It still retains its class and level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving
therefrom (such as base attack @nbonus, base save bonuses, and hit points).
It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that arent extraordinary, 
supernatural, or spell-like abilities.
@n
@nIncorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being polymorphed,and a creature
with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.

spheres of light (which look like will-o-wisps), or one faintly glowing, 
vaguely humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius 
area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no 
concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning 
corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light 
winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spells range.

spell-calm-animals
This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless.
Only ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2) can be affected
by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more
than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is 
equal to 2d4 + caster level. A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or 
guard is allowed a saving throw
 other animals are not.
The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. 
They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat
breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

spell-chain-lightning
This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke
commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes
one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.
@n
The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6)
to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of
secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts
each strike one target and deal half as much damage as the primary one did
(rounded down).
@n
Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. You choose 
secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary
target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer
secondary targets than the maximum.

spell-charm-animal
This charm makes a animal creature regard you as its trusted friend and 
ally (treat the targets attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently
being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5
bonus on its saving throw.
@n
The spell does not enable you to control the charmed animal as if it were an
automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way.
You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma 
check to convince it to do anything it wouldnt ordinarily do. (Retries are not
allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders,
but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act 
by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell.

spell-chill-touch
A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force
of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points
of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it
makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack
up to one time per level.
@n
An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make
a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds +1 round
per caster level.

spell-cloudkill
This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that its 
vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any
living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD
is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4
points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).
@n
A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on
your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this
damage). Holding ones breath doesnt help, but creatures immune to poison are
unaffected by the spell.
@n
Unlike a fog cloud, the cloudkill moves away from you at 10 feet per round,
rolling along the surface of the ground.
@n
Figure out the clouds new spread each round based on its new point of origin,
which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.
@n
Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the
land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids,
nor can it be cast underwater.

spell-comprehend-languages
You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise
incomprehensible written messages. In either case, you must touch the creature
or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into
the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand
or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.
@n
Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute.
Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. 
This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the secret page and 
illusory script spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed
in otherwise normal text.
@n
Comprehend languages can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

spell-control-weather
You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the 
spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call 
forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in.
@n
You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and 
intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the 
weatherwhere lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. 
When you select a certain weather condition to occur, the weather assumes that 
condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually, not abruptly). The weather 
continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action 
to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). 
Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.
@n
Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or 
otherwise) as well as create them.
@n
A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle with a 
3-mile radius.

spell-delayed-blast-fireball
A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and 
deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to every 
creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The 
explosion creates almost no pressure.
@n
The glowing bead created by delayed blast fireball can detonate immediately if 
you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You 
select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot 
change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead (see below). If 
you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. 
A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 
feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, 
there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.

spell-detect-magic
You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how 
long you study a particular area or subject.
@n
1st Round
Presence or absence of magical auras.
@n
2nd Round
Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
@n
3rd Round
The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the 
auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine 
the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura
 DC 15 + spell 
level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)
@n
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may 
distort or conceal weaker auras.
Aura Strength
@n
An auras power depends on a spells functioning spell level or an items caster 
level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the 
stronger of the two. 
@n
Lingering Aura
A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) 
or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed 
at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a 
faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original 
power.
@n
Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, 
the conjuration spell registers.
@n
Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate 
barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 
feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
@n
Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

spell-earthquake
When you cast earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the 
ground. The shock knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in 
the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures 
on the ground cant move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a 
Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries 
to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and 
creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on 
the nature of the terrain where it is cast.
@n
Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel
The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any
 creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature 
beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large 
cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.
Cliffs
@n
Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally 
as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning 
damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
@n
Open Ground
Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures 
open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one 
(Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, 
killing any creatures still trapped within.
@n
Structure
Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a 
typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced 
masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to 
objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points 
of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).
@n
River, Lake, or Marsh
Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming 
muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, 
sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 
Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of 
the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught 
in the mud.
@n
Pinned beneath Rubble
Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while 
pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution 
check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

There is no saving throw to avoid gaining the negative levels, but 24 hours 
after gaining them, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = energy 
drain spells save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that 
negative level is removed. If it fails, the negative level also goes away, but 
one of the subjects character levels is permanently drained.

spell-entangle
Grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures 
in the area or those that enter the area, holding them fast and causing them to 
become entangled. The creature can break free and move half its normal speed by 
using a full-round action to make a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape 
Artist check. A creature that succeeds on a Reflex save is not entangled but can 
still move at only half speed through the area. Each round on your turn, the 
plants once again attempt to entangle all creatures that have avoided or escaped 
entanglement.

light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures

spell-fire-shield
This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that 
attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or 
fire-based attacks (your choice).
@n
Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, 
but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster 
level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if the shield protects 
against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the shield protects against 
cold-based attacks). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this 
effect. Creatures wielding weapons with exceptional reach are not subject to 
this damage if they attack you.
@n
When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are 
thin and wispy, giving off light equal to only half the illumination of a 
normal torch (10 feet). The color of the flames is determined randomly 
(50% chance of either color)blue or green if the chill shield is cast, 
violet or blue if the warm shield is employed. The special powers of each 
version are as follows.
@n
Warm Shield
The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. 
If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a 
successful save.
@n
Chill Shield
The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. 
If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a 
successful save.

spell-fireball
A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and 
deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature 
within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates 
almost no pressure.
@n
You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the 
fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit 
and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining 
the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact 
results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow 
passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must hit the opening with a ranged 
touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt 
metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If 
the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the 
fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits
 otherwise it stops 
at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

to any target it hits. A flaming projectile can easily ignite a flammable object 
or structure, but it wont ignite a creature it strikes.

spell-fly
The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or 
heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half 
speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a fly 
spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack 
or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and 
it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears.
@n
Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails 
slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches 
the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of 
the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a 
spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fly spell 
is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.

spell-haste
The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed 
has several effects. When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may 
make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using 
the creatures full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the 
situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that 
provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, 
so you cant use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action
in the round.)
@n
A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC
and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to 
Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.
@n
All of the hasted creatures modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, 
climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subjects 
normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement 
bonus, and it affects the creatures jumping distance as normal for increased 
speed.
@n
Multiple haste effects dont stack. Haste dispels and counters slow.

spell-invisibility
The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even 
from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, 
too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see 
the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic 
to do so.
@n
Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible
 items picked 
up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, 
however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, 
the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that 
the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.
@n
Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions 
can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell 
ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack 
includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. 
(Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible characters perceptions.) 
Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm 
indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, 
eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes 
holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger 
traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the 
subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along 
with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies 
but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes 
in their area.
@n
Invisibility can be made permanent (on objects only) with a permanency spell.

spell-levitate
Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and 
down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object 
must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally 
direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round
 doing 
so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the 
recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push 
against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).
@n
A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself 
increasingly unstable
 the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the 
second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent 
stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.

spell-meteor-swarm
Meteor swarm is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to fireball in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstreched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres l
ave a fiery trail of sparks. 

If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike with the meteor. Any creature struck by one of these spheres takes 2d6 points of blugeoning damage (no save) and receives no saving throw against the sphere's fire d
mage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. You may aim more than one meteor at the same target.

Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. (Fire resistanc
 applies to each sphere's damage individually.)

spell-passwall
You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through 
metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 
5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, 
and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the walls thickness is more 
than the depth of the passage created, then a single passwall simply makes a 
niche or short tunnel. Several passwall spells can then form a continuing 
passage to breach very thick walls. When passwall ends, creatures within 
the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the 
passwall or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far 
exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.

spell-raise-dead
You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been 
dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subjects 
soul must be free and willing to return. If the subjects soul is not willing 
to return, the spell does not work
 therefore, a subject that wants to return 
receives no saving throw.
@n
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level 
(or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to 
an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of 
Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it cant be 
raised). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. 
A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given 
spell upon being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A 
spellcasting creature that doesnt prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 
50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to 
cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.
@n
A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice. 
Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal 
disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases 
and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs 
lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. 
Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to 
life. None of the dead creatures equipment or possessions are affected in any 
way by this spell.
@n
A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death 
effect cant be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and 
undead creatures cant be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that 
has died of old age.

spell-reincarnate
With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that 
its death occurred no more than one week before the casting of the spell and 
the subjects soul is free and willing to return. If the subjects soul is not 
willing to return, the spell does not work
 therefore, a subject that wants to 
return receives no saving throw. 
@n
Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and 
afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So 
long as some small portion of the creatures body still exists, it can be 
reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the 
creatures body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely 
new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. 
This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. 
@n
A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It 
retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, 
base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, 
Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate 
the subjects racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and 
then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subjects 
level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution 
score is reduced by 2. (If this reduction would put its Con at 0 or lower, it 
cant be reincarnated). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.
@n
Its possible for the change in the subjects ability scores to make it 
difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, 
the subject is well advised to become a multiclass character.
@n
For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the following 
table. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type 
should be created.
@n
A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death 
effect cant be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, 
outsiders, and undead creatures cant be reincarnated. The spell cannot 
bring back a creature who has died of old age.
@n
The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new 
form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural 
attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesnt 
automatically speak the language of the new form.
@n
A wish or a miracle spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or 
her original form.

spell-resurrection
This spell functions like raise dead, except that you are able to restore life 
and complete strength to any deceased creature.
@n
The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of 
the creatures body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion 
receiving the spell must have been part of the creatures body at the time of 
death. (The remains of a creature hit by a disintegrate spell count as a small 
portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years 
per caster level.
@n
Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit 
points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. However, the subject 
loses one level, or 2 points of Constitution if the subject was 1st level. (If 
this reduction would bring its Con to 0 or lower, it cant be resurrected). 
This level loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.
@n
You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been 
turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone 
who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead

If it succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level.

spell-sleep
A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. 
Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.
@n
Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spells point of 
origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature 
are wasted.
@n
Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, 
but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an 
application of the aid another action).
@n
Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

spell-slow
An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A slowed 
creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but 
not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 
penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half 
its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the 
creatures jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.
@n
Multiple slow effects dont stack. Slow counters and dispels haste.

spell-stoneskin
The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The 
subject gains damage reduction 10/adamantine. (It ignores the first 10 points 
of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon 
bypasses the reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of 
damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its 
ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to 
attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can
 it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be 
summoned into an environment that cannot support them.

spell-teleport
This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be 
as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. 
You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesnt exceed your maximum 
load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature 
(carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) 
per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a 
Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to 
be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those 
creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is 
personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell 
resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another 
person receive saving throws and spell resistance.
@n
You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. 
The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas 
of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or 
even impossible.
@n
To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. 
Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.
@n
Familiarity
Very familiar is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at 
home. Studied carefully is a place you know well, either because you can 
currently see it, youve been there often, or you have used other means (such
as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour. Seen casually is a 
place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. 
Viewed once is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.
@n
False destination is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting 
to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so 
completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false 
destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%,
 since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off 
target from.
@n
On Target
You appear where you want to be.
@n
Off Target
You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. 
Distance off target is 1d101d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The 
direction off target is determined randomly
@n
Similar Area
You wind up in an area thats visually or thematically similar to the target area.
@n
Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area 
exists within the spells range, the spell simply fails instead.
@n
Mishap
You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled. You each take 
1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For 
these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time Mishap comes up, the characters take more 
damage and must reroll.

This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the

This spell functions like raise dead, except that you can resurrect a creature

bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you 
unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceaseds 
time and place of birth or death is the most common method).
@n
Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit 
points, vigor, and health, with no loss of level (or Constitution points) or 
prepared spells.
@n
You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned 
into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect 
elementals or outsiders, but it cant resurrect constructs or undead creatures.

spell-waterwalk
The transmuted creatures can tread on any liquid as if it were firm ground. 
Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed 
easily, since the subjects feet hover an inch or two above the surface. 
(Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they 
are near it.) The subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the 
surface as if it were normal ground.
@n
If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or wholly 
submerged in whatever liquid they are in), the subjects are borne toward the 
surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.

spell-word-of-recall
Word of recall teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is
uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it 
must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area 
no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a 
plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, 
any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesnt exceed your maximum load. 
You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear 
or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A 
Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two 
Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in 
contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact 
with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.
@n
An unwilling creature cant be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a 
creatures Will save (or spell resistance) prevents items in its possession 
from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.

This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. 
Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, 
or in an area three times as largepossibly creating a downpour or filling many 
small receptacles.
@n
Note: Conjuration spells cant create substances or objects within a creature. 
Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 
8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

SPELL-FIREBALL
A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and 
deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to every 
creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The 
explosion creates almost no pressure.
@n
The glowing bead created by delayed blast fireball can detonate immediately if 
you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You 
select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot 
change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead (see below). If 
you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. 
A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 
feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, 
there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.

RACE-AASIMAR
@nGraced with a touch of the holy, aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and
generally pleasant. Some have a minor physical trait suggesting their heritage,
such as silver hair, golden eyes, or an unnaturally intense stare.
@n
Most aasimars are decidedly good-aligned. They fight against evil causes and
attempt to sway others to do the right thing. Occassionally they take on the
vengeful judgemental aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this is rare. They
are rarely found in leadership positions and often live as loners due to their
absolute dedication to goodness. Others are less fanatical and fit seamlessly
into normal human society.

Skill Use Magic Device
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device 
  checks related to scrolls.
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic 
  Device checks related to scrolls.
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to Spellcraft 
  checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.
Use this skill to activate magic
Check
@n
You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic 
Device  lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features 
of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different 
alignment.
@n
You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. 
If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an 
ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.
@n
You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know 
what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that 
purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are 
summarized on the table below. 
@n
Activate Blindly
Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can 
activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or 
action, even when youre not and even if you dont know it. You do have to perform 
some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave 
the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 
bonus on your Use Magic Device check if youve activated the item in question at 
least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you cant activate the device. If you 
fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets 
released but it doesnt do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that 
the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, 
dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for 
a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could 
not otherwise cast yourself.
@n
Decipher a Written Spell
This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, 
except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 
minute of concentration.
@n
Emulate an Ability Score
To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability 
(Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer 
or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class youre 
emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device 
check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate 
ability, you dont need to make this check.
@n
Emulate an Alignment
Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the users alignment. 
Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your 
choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.
Emulate a Class Feature
@n
Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, 
your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check 
result minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of 
another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. 
If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you 
must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a 
separate Use Magic Device check (see above).
@n
Emulate a Race
Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members 
of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You 
can emulate only one race at a time.
@n
Use a Scroll
If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to 
cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scrolls spell on your class spell list. 
Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your 
class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying 
to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum 
score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you dont have a sufficient 
score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic 
Device check (see above).
@n
This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.
@n
Use a Wand
Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wands spell on your class spell list. 
This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on 
your class spell list. This use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger 
magic items, such as staffs.
@n
Action
None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required 
to activate the magic item.
Try Again
@n
Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you 
fail, then you cant try to activate that item again for 24 hours.
Special
@n
You cannot take 10 with this skill.
@n
You cant aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt 
such a check.
@n
If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks.
@n
Synergy
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device 
  checks related to scrolls.
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic 
  Device checks related to scrolls.
* If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to Spellcraft 
  checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.

CLASS-MAGE

 @nThe mage's strength is her spells.  Everything else is secondary. She learns
 new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn
 them from other mages. In addition to learning new spells, a mage can, over
 time, learn to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are
 improved in some other way.

 Overall, mages show a slight tendency toward law over chaos because the study
 of magic rewards those who are disciplined. Illusionists and transmuters,
 however, are masters of deception and change, respectively.  They favor chaos
 over law.

@YMage Class Features@n
 Alignment:       Any
 Hit Die:         d4
 Primary Stat:    Intelligence (Spell Casting)
 Secondary Stats: Dexterity (Armor) and Constitution (Hit Points)

@YSpells@n
 A mage casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/mage spell list.

 A mage must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time using the @Ymem@n command.
 Ex: mem light
     mem magic-missile

 To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the mage must have an Intelligence score equal
 to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a
 mages spell is 10 + the spell level + the mage's Intelligence modifier.

 Mages cast spells using the @Ycast@n command.
 Ex: cast 'magic missile' <target>

@YClass Skills@n
 Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Profession (Wis),
 Spellcraft (Int).

 Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4
 Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier

@YWeapon and Armor Proficieny@n
 Proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and
 quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type
 interferes with a mage's movements, which can cause her spells with
 somatic components to fail.

 For a table explaining Wizard level gains, type @Yhelp table wizard@n.
 For a spell table for wizards, type @Yhelp spelltable wizard@n.
 For a spell listing for wizards, type @Yhelp spelllist wizard@n.
 For a list of wizard bonus feats, type @Yhelp bonus feats wizard@n.

CLASS-ABILITY-KI-DAMAGE
@n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@n
&YAs a Weapon Master
@n After you score a hit with your weaponof choice, you do not roll dice to
@n determine the damage.  Instead, you figure the normal maximum damage (not a
@n critical hit) you can inflict with that weapon and do that much damage to the
@n target. Assume you use a longsword, have a base attack bonus of +7, and 
@n possess a 17 Strength. A longsword does 1d8 damage, so its maximum damage is
@n 8 points. Your strength modifier is +3, so add that for a total of 11.
@n Additional damage, such as from using the Power Attack feat and the sneak
@n attack ability are determined normally, they are not maximized. This ability
@n cannot be used when you roll a successful critical hit.
@n

CLASS-ABILITY-INCREASED-MULTIPLIER
@n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@n
&YAs a Weapon Master
@n Determine the standard critical multiplier for your weapon of choice. With this
@n ability, you can increase that multiplier by +1. For example, the longsword has
@n a critical mutliplier of X2. Using this ability, you can increase that to X3
@n once per day at 2nd level. You must declare the use of this ability before you
@n roll any damage dice.

@n attack rolls with the weapon master's weapon of choice.

CLASS-ABILITY-SUPERIOR-COMBAT-REFLEXES

@n
&YAs a Weapon Master

@n an additional +2 to your weapon of choice's threat range for critical hits.

furian
Furian is one of Forgrim's most ferocious killers. He is often spotted
striding through the lands in his blood-splattered armour. Never fated
to be a statesman or philosopher was this one! He negotiates with his
sword which knows no mercy. Though quite intelligent by Hordeman standards,
this demonic fighter lets Forgrim sort out the bodies and leaves the
reflection on its meaning to those with little else to occupy their
time.

RULES-EVIL

@RALL EVIL ROLE PLAY MUST BE KEPT RATED PG@n

When role playing your characters who are evil, you must keep all content rated
PG at all times.  We do not want to see graphic violence in your language or
descriptions, or extremely dark and twisted plots.  Voldemort of Harry potter or
Sauron of Lord of the Rings is the extent of our villainy here.  Those who attempt
to go further will be warned, and those who argue or do not desist immediately will
be punished.

Secondly, @Rthis is not a pk MUD!@n.  Attempts in using evil role play to incite
others to engage in pk with you will be dealt with harshly.  You may pk if you like,
but it should be part of a mutually consentual role played plot, and not the result
of you inciting someone to anger or mistreating them through role play or ooc conduct.
Those who act in such a manner will be warned, and those who argue or continue will be
punished.

I would like to say that we do not discourage evil role play at all, just the extent
of it.  We feel evil role play is a valuable, even essential part of having a fun
game.  After all if there are no bad guys who are the good guys going to fight.

Also we are currently making plans to implement a robust pk system in which consentual
pvp play can take place, including special awards for those who take part unavailable
any other way.

feat-damage-reduction
@CDamage Reduction @n

A creature with this special quality ignores damage from most weapons and
natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly
(in either case, the opponetknows the attack was ineffective). The creature 
takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, 
spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A certain kind of weapon
can sometimes damage the creature normally, as noted below.

The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and
the type of weapon that negates the ability.

Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage.

Some monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as alchemical silver, 
adamantine, or cold iron. Attacks from weapons that are not made of the 
correct material have their damage reduced, even if the weapon has an 
enhancement bonus.

Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any weapon with at least a +1
magical enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls overcomes the damage 
reduction of these monsters. Such creatures' natural weapons (but not their
attacks with weapons) are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of 
overcoming damage reduction.

A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic weapons; that is, 
magic weapons with at least a +6 enhancement bonus. Such creatures' natural
weapons are also treated as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned
weapons. When a cleric casts align weapon, affected weapons might gain one 
or more of these properties, and certain magic weapons have these properties 
as well. A creature with an alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful)
can overcome this type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and 
weapons it wields as is the weapons or natural weapons had an alignment (or
alignments) that match the subtype(s) of the creature.

When a damage reduction entry has a (-) after the slash, no weapon negates the
damage reduction.

A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either
type overcomes this damage reduction.

A few other creatures require combinations of different types of attacks to
overcome their damage reduction. A weapon must be both types to overcome
this damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type is still subject to
overcome this damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type is still 
subject to damage reduction.

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or 
higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage 
reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an 
alignment gains the alignment of the projectile weapon (in addition to any
alignment it may already have).

Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it 
also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as injury
type poison, a monk's stunning, and injury type disease. Damage reduction does
not negate touch attacks, energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy 
drains. Nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, 
ingestion, or contact.

Attacks that deal no damage because of the target's damage reduction do not 
disrupt spells.

If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of 
damage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the
best damage reduction in a given situation.

Special

The barbarian class gains damage reduction by (1/-) every three levels 
starting from the 7th level as such (1/- at level 7, 2/- at level 10, 
3/- at level 13, 4/- at level 16, 5/- at level 19).

The prestige class Dwarven Defender gains damage reduction 3/- at level 6
and damage reduction 6/- at level 10.

@C[@GEpic@C]@n

Prerequisite

Con 21

Benefit

You gain damage reduction 3/-. This does not stack with damage reduction 
granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects, but it does stack with
any damage reduction granted by permanent magical affects, class features, or
this feat itself.

Special

You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you gain the feat, your damage
reduction increases by 3.

The barbarian Epic class will continue to gain (1/-) damage reduction every 
three levels after level 19 as such (6/- at levl 22, 7/- at level 25, 
8/- at level 28 and so on).

The prestige Epic class Dwarven Defender will continue to gain (3/-) damage 
reduction for every four levels above level 10 as such (9/- at level 14,
12/- at level 18 and so on).

feat-fast-healing
@CFast Healing @n

A creature with fast healing has the extraordinary ability to regain hitpoints
at an exceptional rate. Except for what is noted here, fast healing is like
natural healing.

At the beginning of each creature's turn, it heals a certain number of 
hitpoints (defined in its description).

Unlike regeneration, fast healing does not allow a creature to regrow or 
reattach lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost
body parts to be reattached.

A creature that has taken both nonlethal and lethal damage heals the 
nonlethal damage first.

Fast healing does not restore hitpoints lost from starvation, thrist, or 
suffocation.

Fast healing does not increase the number of hitpoints regained when a 
creature polymorphs.

@C[@GEpic@C]@n

Con 25

Benefit

You gain fast healing 3, or your existing fast healing increases by 3. This 
feat does not stack with fast healing granted by magic items or non permanent

CLASS-FEATS

  Class feats are feats obtained that can be selected from a certain list
and only while a certain class is active.  Each class has it's own counter
of class feats, so if you gain a level in fighter for example, you will have
to spend your class feat before you take a different class, or you will have
to wait until you take a level in fighter again before you can spend it.

RULES-TITLES

@RFANTASY BASED TITLES ONLY.  NO STATUS UPDATES PLEASE@n

You may set your own title using the title command but we have certain rules
that go along with this feature and allowance.  The main idea is that all
titles must be in character and appropriate for your character in some way.

We don't want to see frivilous titles or titles that advertise your current
mood or character's state of being.  A title is just that, a title, it
is not meant to be an expression of philosophy, mood, humor, or anything
else.  Also your title must include your character's name.

Here are some examples of good titles:
Caide Delancis, Purple Dragon Knight of Cormyr
Thoran Khadgar, Chieftain's Son of the Tribe of the Bear
Valos D'Raden, Initiate of the Hosttower of the Arcane

Here are some bad examples of titles:
Caide is tired of all the snow.
Thoran is feeling super awesome!
Valos - Owner of all Halflings in Faerun

These rules are very clear, and if they are not, ask an imm before you set
your title.  If you set your title to something inappropriate, it will be
changed for you.  If you do this more than once, you will lose the ability
to set your own title until we feel we can trust you with it again, which
may take months.


It should also be noted that a title does not have to be legitimate.  For
example, one could set their title to attempt to pose as something else, such
as a Knight of Solamnia, or a Lord, or what have you.  The only thing that is not
allowed here is attempting to impersonate a specific person.  In such cases
disciplinary action will be taken.

REMAKE-RULES
Remaking your character is not something that you can do just because
you have decided you don't like where you put your stats or how you
chose your feats. There are only two ways to have your character
remade. The first way is to have 20,000 account experience accrued.
The same rules for previous remakes applies, except you can change
your classes as long as the general character idea stays the same.
Generally your basic classes should remain more or less the same,
and prestige classes should change. A mage could change to a sorcerer,
but not to a cleric or a fighter.

The second way is if your character is bugged and the only way to
fix it is to remake your character to get rid of the bug.


If you feel you are bugged please let the staff know and we will
be in touch with you about the problem. If you wish to remake
useing your account experience you must first submit a request
to the staff about why you wish to remake. We will then review it
and speak with you about it.

LFG

  The lfg command is used for looking for groups.  The syntax is as follows:

lfg:
  This will list all players on the mud current looking for a group.

lfg set:
  This will toggle whether you are looking for a group or not.  Once
  you are grouped your lfg flag will automatically be removed.

ROLE-PLAYING

Role playing is encouraged here on d20mud: Forgotten Realms, though it is
not enforced.

A lot of information is available on this mud, not all of which is known
by your character.  Anything labelled IC (in character) is able to be known
by your character.  Everything else is OOC (out of character) and is known
only by you, the player, and it is expected that you make an effort to separate
what you know from what your character knows, also known as meta-gaming.

IC Information includes: anything said with the say command, anything seen
with the look command, all objects, rooms and mobs are ic, unless otherwise
stated in their descriptions, combat is considered ic, so be careful what
you kill in whose presence, and be extra careful about killing citizens of
cities while others are around, information shown by your score is ic,
introductions are ic, narrate channel is ic.

Everything else is ooc, and is not known by your character.  When it comes
to things like stats your character only knows general effectiveness.  He
does not know a longsword is +4, but he does know it has a powerful
enchantment on it if he has identified it somehow.  The same goes for character
stats, skills, feats, abilities and so on.  Exact numbers are not known by
characters, but general effects and extent thereof is.

If you have any questions about what else is considered ic or ooc, please
ask an imm or another player.  If you cannot get your answer on chat or newbie,
consider making a post on our forums.

CLASS-CLERIC
The Cleric is the ultimate divine spellcaster, and testiment to the power of
the pantheon. Wielding spells and abilities gifted to them by their gods, the
Cleric can serve as anything from a goodly healer to an agent of destruction.
Unlike many other spellcasters, he can wear heavy armor without casting penalty
although he still must train to use martial weapons.

Like the gods they serve, clerics can be of any alignment. Typically, clerics
are the same alignment as their deity, although some are one step away from
their respective deities alignment.

Cleric Class Features
 Alignment:    Any (Same as deity, or one step removed)
 Hit Die:      d8

Class Skills
 Combat Tactics (Dex), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),
 Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Lore (Int), Spellcraft (Int).

Domain Class Skills
 A cleric who chooses the Travel domain adds Survival (Wis) to their class
 skill list. A cleric who chooses Trickery adds Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha),
 and Hide (Dex) to their class skill list.

Domains
 A cleric, after choosing their deity, selects two domains from that deities
 portfolio. These domains grant the cleric access to specific domain spells
 as well as potential extra abilties. Type @whelp domains@n for a listing of
 domains, and @whelp domain <name>@n for a specific domain listing.

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4
 Skill Points at Each Level:  2 + Int modifier

Weapon and Armor Proficiency
 All simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, heavy), and
 with shields (except tower shields). Each deity has a favored weapon, and
 his or her clerics consider it a point of pride to wield that weapon. A
cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to
 that weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon
 Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.

For a table explaining Cleric level gains - @whelp table cleric@n
For a spell table for Clerics, type @whelp spelltable cleric@n.

@nA flame strike produces a vertical column of divine fire roaring downward. The
spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage
is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is
therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.

SPELL-FREEDOM-OF-MOVEMENT
@nThis spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack normally for
the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually
impedes movement, such as paralysis, solid fog, slow, and web. The subject
automatically succeeds on any grapple check made to resist a grapple attempt, as
well as on grapple checks or Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple.
@n
The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater,
even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons
such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the
hand rather than hurled. The freedom of movement spell does not, however, allow
water breathing.

RACE-ORC
@nOrcs are aggressive humanoids that raid, pillage, and battle other creatures.
They have a hatred of elves and dwarves that began generations ago, and often
kill such creatures on sight. An orc's hair usually is black. It has lupine ears
and reddish eyes. Orcs prefer wearing vivid colors that many humans would
consider unpleasant, such as blood red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep
purple. Their equipment is dirty and unkempt. An adult male orc is a little over
6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds. Females are slightly smaller.

RACE-GOLD-DWARF
Unlike the shield dwarves, the gold dwarves maintained their great kingdom in
the Great Rift and did not decline in terrible wars against evil humanoids.
While they practiced some magic, they never acquired the hubris that caused the
downfall of some human nations. Confident and secure in their remote home, the
gold dwarves gained a reputation for haughtiness and pride.

RACE-SHIELD-DWARF
@nUnlike ancient human empires, the shield dwarves distrusted magic, so they were
never seduced to the heights of magical folly that toplled Netheril and Imaskar.
Instead, the dwarves became locked in eternal wars with goblin-kind, and the
other dwellers in the Underdark. One by one, the dwarven empires of the north
failed, leaving only scattered survivors in the mountains or unconquered
sections of the Underdark.
@n
The clans that survived these battles are the shield dwarves. For many human
generations they were divided into two types: the Hidden, given to reclusion and
secrecy, and the Wanderers, comfortable with other races and inclined to
exploration. Since the Thunder Blessing, the older members of Hidden clans are
beginning to change their hearts.

@nMost half-elves are loners because of their unique parentage. However, a few
stable communities of half-elves are sprinkled around the landscape of Faerun.

relatively high populations of half-elves and are appropriate homelands for

RACE-HALF-DROW
@nMost half-elves are loners because of their unique parentage. Unlike their more
accepted half-elven relatives, the half drow have many social stigmas about them
stemming from their half Drow nature. Drow are notorious, cunning, and evil elven
creatures from the Underdark, and as such, half drow have trouble fitting in
with typical humanoid society.

RACE-HALF-ORC
Even in the tolerant lands of Faerun, a half-orc's life is hardly ever easy.
Some humans areas tolerate half-orcs, making their lives no harder than the
lives of other settlers in the area. Other human areas despise half-orcs and
persecute them, making life in the open with savage orc tribes look survivable
by comparison.
@n
Even more so than half-elves, half-orcs tend to be loners. Most remain among the
orc tribes, where their human intelligence and leadership offers a hope of
advancement. Among human lands, Amn, Chessenta, Damara, the Moonsea, the North,
Vaasa, and Waterdeep are regions in which half-orcs are commonplace enough to
be accepted, within certain limits.

SPELL-EPIC-MAGE-ARMOR
@nAn invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of epic mage
armor, providing a +20 armor bonus to Armor Class. Unlike mundane armor, epic
mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed
reduction. Because epic mage armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't
bypass it the way they do normal armor.

EPIC-SPELLS
@nEpic spells are available to all players who have attained epic class levels.
@n
@nYour epic level spells / day is equal to You Lore skill / 10. A lore of 30, for
example, would grant 3 epic spells / day.
@n
@nCasting epic spells is the same as whatever your epic class uses. A mage would
use cast, and a cleric would use pray.
@n
Each epic spell has a spellcraft DC which must be met to cast the spell. For
more information on a specific epic spell, type @Yhelp spell <spellname>@n, for
example, @Yhelp spell dragon knight@n.

10 SKILLS
@nThere are four types of skills: class, cross-class, languages, and artisan.
@n
Typing either "skills" or "practice" will show class, cross-class, and language
skills. In order to raise these skills, practice sessions must be spent at a
trainer (such as Jolin in Luskan). Class skills cost 1 practice, while cross-
class and language skills cost 2 practice sessions (unless you have the Able
Learner feat, in which case all skills cost 1 session).
@n
Languages only need to be practiced once to know, but class skills can be raised
as high as your level +3. A level 7 could have 10 practices spent on a single
skill, greatly raising their chances for success. A cross-class skill can only
be half of that, (level +3) / 2. This means that a level 7 could have 5 ranks
within a cross-class skill for their class.
@n
Artisan skills are entirely different, and have their own system. For help on
Artisan (crafting) skills, type @Yhelp class artisan@n.
@n
For help on a specific skill, type @Yhelp skill <skillname>@n.
For example, @Yhelp skill bluff@n.

5 MOVEMENT
@nThis MUD uses rooms which are linked together. Rooms are a generalization for
underground sewer, or a fairly large path in the forest. The best way to think
about rooms, is that they are all points on a map with specific exits.
@n
Exits include "@Cnorth@n" "@Ceast@n" "@Csouth@n" "@Cwest@n" "@Cup@n" "@Cdown@n" "@Cnorthwest@n" "@Cnortheast@n"
@Csouthwest@n and "@Csoutheast@n"
@n
At any time, you can type "look" and see your current room. Available exits
will be displayed underneath the "Obvious Exits" field, and also in the minimap
on the right side of the displayed text. Typing "exits" will display just the
available exits in your current room.
@n
To move around, simple type the direction you want to go. For example, type "n"
to go north. Sometimes, you may encounter a barrier in your way, such as a door
or gate. When you walk into one of these, you'll receive a message similar to
The cell seems to be closed.
In this message, "cell" is the name of the door, so we can "open cell" to open
this pathway. Sometimes, you will also see the following.
It seems to be locked.
This means that the exit is locked. A person with a high "open lock" skill can
try to "pick cell" to pick open the lock, or simply having the key in your
inventory and typing "unlock cell" will unlock the door.
@n
As far as the automap goes, if you type in "map" you will see a larger version
of the automap, as well as a key displaying the room types.
@n
If you ever with to turn the automap function off, simply type "@Cautomap@n" to
toggle it on and off.

RP ROLE-PLAYING IN-CHARACTER OUT-OF-CHARACTER

@Yd20MUD: Age of Dragons@n is a role playing expected MUD.  That means we expect
people to role play, but do not punish those who don't as long as they use the
proper communication channels for their out of character communication, and do
not disrupt or disturb the role playing of others.

What do we consider role playing?  We consider role playing to be the taking on
of a fictional and original character in the Dragonlance universe and
acting as if you were that person as you play the game.  For example, a qualinesti
elf might role play as an orphan whose parents were killed by goblins in a raid on
their village.  After living alone in the wild for some time, he happened upon
a human village who he eventually befriended.  From there he made a life as a
ranger assisting the humans until they too were slaughtered by goblins.  Fearing
the harm that could come from further attacks he went out into the world to
learn and grow so that one day he could stop the goblin hordes from any more massacres.

This is one example of a character you create but the possibilities are endless.
Remember that whatever character you create, he or she is a real person, with real
strengths and weaknesses, virtues and flaws, and a real personality, potentially
quite different from your own.

The other thing that needs clarification is the difference between in character
and out of character.

In character is your state of play when you are acting as your character and not
speaking as the person at the computer.  You should only use information that your
character would know, and communicate in a way that makes sense.  For example,
you know the other character at the bar is your friend, but your character doesn't.
You should try to act out a role playing scenario in which the two characters meet
and discover a reason why they should go adventuring together.  Also, regarding item
stats remember that your character doesn't know that an item is +1 or +2 or +10.
All he knows is that it is magical, and to what general degree.  So use the proper
words to explain magical effects.  For example a +5 flaming long sword might be
explained as "a long sword with a powerful magical enchantment whose blade may be
engulfed in flames that harm enemies but not the owner".  Be creative and simply
make your best attempt.  We are more worried about the existance of role play than
the quality thereof.

Out of character communication, by contrast, is when you are speaking about things
only you, the real person at the computer, knows.  Stuff about the real world, game
stats and other game topics your character doesn't know, and in essence, anything
that you wouldn't see a character in a Dragonlance novel say or do, should
be said on an out of character channel.

In Character Channels Include: rsay, rgsay, shout, emote, socials, mail
Out of Character Channels Include: ooc, gsay, chat, newbie, socials, mail, tell
guildchat, clantalk, emotes (outside of taverns only)

If you have any questions about role playing, please post your question on our forums
and we will answer it as promptly and as best we can.

@nRock gnomes are the most common type of gnomes in Faerun, and are usually just
called gnomes, since they are the only sort that surface dwellers ever see. They
are inquisitive, irrepressible, and at times insincere. Equipped by nature with
a keen curiosity and a knack for mechanical workings, gnomes excel at intricate
crafts such as gemcutting, toymaking, and clockwork engineering. They happen to
be the finest gunsmiths in Faerun, and they are the most likely of any race to
arm themselves with smokepowder firearms.

Class-Arcane-Trickster
@YHit Die@n

d4

@YRequirements@n

To qualify to become an arcane trickster, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria:

Alignment: Any nonlawful
Skills: Decipher Script 7 ranks, Disable Device 7 ranks, Escape Artist 7 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks.
Spells: Ability to cast mage hand and at least one arcane spell of 3rd level or higher.
Special: Sneak attack +2d6.

@YClass Skills@n

The arcane trickster's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape A
tist (Dex), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (all skills taken individually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex),  
Speak Language (None), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Use Rope (Dex). 

@YSkill Points at Each Level@n

4 + Int modifier.

@YWeapon and Armor Proficiency@n

Arcane tricksters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

@YSpells per Day@n

When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that
class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting.  
If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane trickster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

CHARACTER-CREATION CHARACTER-GENERATION

Our character creation system is one of the best things we have going
for us.  But unfortunately, for a new character, it can be a bit imposing
and time consuming, given the amount of choices available.  It is especially
difficult for someone who is not well versed on D&&D and even for those that
are, there is enough different with our MUD that such knowledge isn't going
to garauntee easy choices.

With that said let's walk you through character creation.  It is assumed by
now that you have chosen a name and a gender and are in the game.  Your first
task is to read the rules of the mud.  This only needs to be done once per
account, so make sure you at least glance over them, and make a note to go
back and fully read them during your first week of playing here.
The next step is to choose a race.  Each race has certain benefits and
disadvantages, and some are clearly advantageous for specific builds over
others.  Please note that there are some races, advanced races, which cost
account experience, and can only be chosen by experienced players who have
proven themselves to staff as beneficial players to the MUD in some way.

If a help entry is not available for your race, try searching for it on the
web.  All of our races use stock D&&D 3.5e rules so if we haven't gotten around
to adding the help for it (and we will!), then the information is still out
there.

Next step is stat selection.  This is an important phase.  Generally speaking
it costs 1 point to go up to 15, 2 for 16, 3 for 17 and 4 for 18.  Racial
modifiers are added when you select your class.  Every stat has a use in this
game, though as always, some are better for certain builds than others.

After stat selection you must select your description.  This is what people
see in place of your name when they do not know your character.  It is
dynamically generated and is based on your gender, race, and various adjectives
you use to describe your person.

Finally, with this done, the last step is to select your class and spend your
intial skill and feat points.
For skills you can get a basic idea of what each skill does by typing
'HELP QUICK SKILL DESCS'.  

For feats you can get an idea of what each feat does by typing 'HELP FEATS' 
and reading the information there, but specifically the 'FEATS AVAILABLE DESC'
command will display all feats that you can take with a short description of 
what that feat does.

And that about wraps up character creation.  If you find yourself in need of
more help, feel free to ask another player or imm on the newbie or chat channels.

BOUNTY BOUNTIES

The bounty system is the primary way for adventurers to earn gold in the game.
The system works by assigning you a number of mobs to kill, based on the mobs
that are currently loaded in the world and around your level.  The more mobs
you are asked to kill the greater the rewards will be.  Rewards include gold,
quest points, experience and a chance for a random magic item as well.

To take a new bounty type @Ybounty new@n.
Optionally, you can specify a particular mob to get a bounty on by typing
@Ybounty new@n <target>.
To see your current bounty type @Ybounty@n.
To complete your bounty and receive your reward type @Ybounty complete@n.
To abandon your current bounty type @Ybounty quit@n

Please note that, except for viewing your current bounty, all bounty commands
must be made at a bounty officer.

#0
BACKUP REIMBURSEMENTS

  The backup command allows you to create a copy of your equipment file at
any time.  If, for any reason you lose your equipment, you can talk to a staff
member, and they can instantly reimburse all of your equipment with a single
command.  The equipment that will be reimbursed will be the same as the last
time you used the backup command, so please use it often.

We warn against using the backup command with triggers or aliases, because if
you lose your equipment somehow, and backup, your reimbursement will not include
any equipment, because the backup will be a copy of your equipment when you had
none.

Regarding reimbursements, we will generally reimburse you equipment for any
instance of a game bug, or through being scammed in some way by another player.
Losing equipment in any other way does not qualify for a reimbursement.  We also
generally do not reimburse gold on hand, though we will reimburse bank gold
if somehow that is lost through a game bug.

In all cases with reimbursements we will give the player the benefit of the
doubt.  However if we do find someone has cheated or lied to us, justice will
be swift and harsh, so please do not abuse our kindness.

Also note that it is your responsibility to keep your equipment backed up.
We will not do manual reimbursements, so either back up, or risk losing
everything.

ABOUT-THE-GAME ABOUT-d20MUD


d20MUD is essentially an OGL Rules Multi User Dungeon.  While our original rule
set was the d20 System, quite a bit has been released since then, especially
with the Pathfinder RPG System, that we have decided to switch from d20 to OGL
instead.

Generally what you can expect from us is to use either d20 rules or Pathfinder
RPG rules whereever possible in-game.  At times we may deviate from these rules
when the stock OGL systems in place are not friendly for or balanced towards a
persistant world type of game.  An example of this is crafting.  In such cases we
will generally look outwards to the rest of the MUD and MMORPG world to find
examples of systems which we think both work well from a balance standpoint and
are also fun to use.

This game is also ever changing.  I expect we will become quite (in)famous for
using the NERF bat.  In essence, we want to create a game that evolves with our
players.  That being said, we know the damage that can be done to games and
communities when the core essence of that game is dramatically altered (Star Wars
Galaxies anyone?), so we will be very careful to keep our alterations minor in
effect wherever possible, and we will also try to make attempts to appease the
majority of our player base.  We will also make as many attempts as possible to
add new features instead of change existing ones.  However despite our best
intentions and efforts, from time to time, a feature we present to the game simply
may not work well, either because functionally it is hard to learn or use, or
because it simply presents game balance issues that severely effect the
game's economy or progression scale.  In such situations we will make the corrections
we feel are necessary, but will always attempt to find out what our player
base thinks are solutions before deciding on a final implementation.

With that said, you can learn more about our game by reading @YHELP INTRODUCTION@n
but to sum things up, our game is meant to give people who like OGL style rules and
who generally enjoy getting along with others, a home here on the Internet where they
can satisfy both desires.

At any time if you have a suggestion or question that can't be answered by another
player, staff member or help file, please contact the owner, Steve Squires at
stephen.squires@@gmail.com.  While he won't necessarily always be the person running
the game, he will always make sure that it maintains the principles upon which it was
built, and is always available to help people understand the game better.

CLASS-DRAGON-DISCIPLE

The dragon disciple is one who takes his fascination with the draconic race
to the ultimate level.  Indeed they aspire to become like a dragon themselves,
and through their successes, eventually they do indeed acquire draconic traits,

senses, and finally culminating with both wings and a morphosis into a half-dragon
humanoid creature.

- Lore skills of 8 or higher
- One level in either bard or sorcerer
- ability to speak draconic language

ALIAS ALIASES

Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

WISHLISTS WISH-LISTS

Wish Lists:
 
Your wish list is a list of items that you prefer to find when you receive
random treasure.  Currently the system only supports weapons, armor and
shields, however more will be added in the future as the random treasure
system is improved upon.
 
The command to us is 'wishlist' and it has 3 options: list, show and erase.
The fourth option is to enter the name of the item you wish to add to the list.
 
'List' will display the correct spellings of all items you are able to add
to the wish list.

'Show' will display your current wish list.

'Erase' will delete everything on your wish list, allowing you to start anew.

Items on your wish list will appear in random treasure about twice as often
as other random items.  However, you will only get a weapon on your wish list
if the treasure table rolls for a weapon, and then rolls for your wish list
item.  Having a wish list does not increase the chance of finding magical
items, or specific types of magical items, only increasing the chance of
finding something useful when the appropriate type of item is rolled.

AUGMENT

AUGMENTING CRYSTALS

By putting more than one crystal of the same type in a crafting station, one is
able to augment the power of the most powerful crystal, destroying all other crystals
in the process.

First find a crafting station.  Then select the crystals of the same type (for example
AC_DEFLECTION) and put as many as you want, at least two, in the crafting station.
Type augment and you will be able to increase the level of the most powerful crystal therein.

For example, if you had a level 20 crystal, a level 10 crystal, and a level 16 crystal, you
would be augmenting the level 20 crystal.  The amount it is augmented is the level of each
crystal within divided by 4 (not total levels, individual crystal levels).  So in the example
above, we would end up with a 20 + 2 (10 / 4) + 4 (16 / 4) or level 26 crystal.

Augmenting does not require any special training to perform.

RACE-QUALINESTI-ELF

Qualinesti elves reside in the Qualinesti forest in the Abanasinia region of
Ansalon.  Their nation was created by a Silvanesti elf prince named Kith-Kanaan,
and has since become a powerful people like unto their high elven cousins.  However,
unlike the Silvanesti, they are relatively open minded towards other races, taking
part in significant trade between dwarves and humans.  Still they keep their borders
relatively closed and well guarded, and generally look down upon inter-racial
relationships.

They are fair skinned with hair colors ranging from blonde, to brown to black and
red, even the occasional silver.  They usually have blue, green or hazel colored
eyes.  They are a little shorter than the average human, and quite a bit more
slender.

RACE-HYLAR-DWARF

The hylar dwarves are a clan of kings and rulers amongst the dwarven castes.
The Thanes are often chosen from this clan, and they have made excellent leaders
over the millennia.  They are stern and sober, well mannered and honorable.

Like all dwarves they stand no greater than 5 feet tall, but they are quite
stocky, with strong muscles and bones to support their relatively small statures.
Both the men and women wear beards, often braided and decorated in the latest
dwarven fashions.  Their hair, eye and skin colors range as widely as humans.

RESIZE

You may resize any weapon, armor or shield to be larger or smaller.  Large
races may need to resize some armor to fit them, and weapons can be resized to
alter both their damage and their eligibility for certain feats such as weapon
finesse and monkey grip.

You need a crafting station to resize something.  You must put the original item
in the station along with enough of the same material the item is made of to 
compensate for the new size and then type resize followed by the new size.

So say I want to resize a steel longsword +1.  I would put the sword in the station
and then I would put in enough steel to compensate for the new size I want, which
in this case is large, and then I type 'resize large'.  The resizing process would
then begin and a few short moments later, the newly resized longsword +1 would appear
in my inventory.

RACE-NEIDAR-DWARF
The Neidar (knoll dwellers) are the name given to those dwarves who at the time 
of the creation of Thorbardin chose to live outside. All hill dwarves are grouped 
into this thanedom. Many of these dwarves could trace their ancestry back to one 
of the other clans. The role of the Neidar prior to the Cataclysm was scouting and 
tending to the flocks outside of Thorbardin. Led by Cale Greeneye, this group was 
indispensable during the war against the wizards and the fight against Rage.

RACE-SILVANESTI-ELF
Silvanesti Elves are a branch of elves that are considered the first civilized 
elves to live on Ansalon. They are descended from the Elderwild Elves (who 
would later call themselves the Kagonesti and are those elves who chose to 
live in cities during the Age of Dreams rather than remain in the forests. 
Silvanesti elves are known to be haughty and proud, considering themselves 
better than any other race, as well as considering themselves superior over 
any other type of elf. The Silvanesti elves are ruled by the Speaker of the 
Stars who is traditionally a member of House Royal.
A normal Silvanesti elf stands at five feet tall and weighs approximately 
ninety to a hundred pounds. They are a fair-skinned race, who have hair color 
that ranges from light brown to white blonde, and hazel eyes. Silvanesti possess 
an almost supernatural beauty and are considered the most graceful and lovely of 
the elves. Most Silvanesti elves never possess facial or body hair, although 
ancient male elves of 500 years and older have been known to grow wispy beards 
from time to time. The high elves normally wear flowing garments that are 
green or brown in coloring.

RACE-KAGONESTI-ELF
Kagonesti Elves are the original and most pure type of elf upon Ansalon, and 
are the clan from which all other elves hail from. During the Age of Dreams 
they were simply known as wild elves, and whilst some of their number chose to 
build great cities and live behind man-made structures (who split from the 
Kagonesti and became known as the Silvanesti), many stayed true to nature and 
lived in the wild. During the Age of Dreams, a wild elf known as Kagonos, who 
was a Pathfinder and nominal leader of the wild elves, led his people away from 
the council of Sinthal-Elish, and chose to truly separate the wild elves and 
the civilized elves. At this time, the wild elves begin to wear tribal tattoos 
and renamed themselves as the Kagonesti.

The average Kagonesti elf stands at just under five feet tall and weighs between 
ninety and a hundred pounds. Due to their outdoor lifestyle, Kagonesti elves have 
tanned skin and are lean and muscular. The hair color of the normal wild elf 
ranges between light brown to black and they normally have hazel eyes. On very 
rare occasions, a Kagonesti elf has been born with silvery-white hair, which 
is sometimes a throwback to an earlier Qualinesti or Silvanesti ancestor. Kagonesti 
elves are considered beautiful by most non-elven races, but are viewed as wild 
barbarians and at best exotic creatures by their own cousins. Kagonesti commonly 
are dressed in leather clothing that has a heavy fringe with feathers and silver 
jewelry, which they believe deters evil spirits away from them.

RACE-PLAINS-BARBARIAN

existing in harmony with nature. These nomads can be found living in the 
Mountain of Krynn.  They all distrust anyone that isn't like them, especially 
"civilized" humans. They will allow for individuals to prove themselves worthy

RACE-KLAR-DWARF

different clans, they are known for their solidarity and willingness to unite

dwarves of Ansalon is the clan in-fighting whilst not facing an enemy. The threat 
of civil war has often been hanging over the heads of the clans, and even broken

RACE-DAEWAR-DWARF
The Daewar were one of the original clans of Kal-Thax. It was under the 
leadership of the Prince Olim Goldbuckle that the Daewar discovered the cavern 
that would later become known as Thorbardin. The Daewar sent the explorer Urkhan 
into a cavern; there he discovered a place that could serve the needs of their 
entire clan. At first, the Daewar attempted to keep the cavern secret from the 
Theiwar, and to move into the cavern and hide from the rest of the dwarven clans. 
With the arrival of the Hylar, and the constant threat of outside attackers, the 
Daewar reluctantly opened their cavern to all the clans.

The Daewar were also the first clan to recognize the importance of the Hylar and 
the two clans often worked together on projects throughout the centuries. During 
the Wizard War the Daewar provided many troops to the effort, including the 
Golden Hammer squad, that was the elite Daewar fighting force.

RACE-DAERGAR-DWARF
The Daergar are also one of the original clans of Kal-Thax. One of their earliest 
known thanes was Vog Ironface, who ruled at the time of the Hylar's arrival. 
After the Hylar's arrival the Daergar played several important roles in the 
Wizards War and the wars against the Empire of Ergoth.

Daergar are the counterparts of the Theiwar in much the same way the Daewar 
are the counterpart of the Hylar. They are the brawn behind the Theiwar brains. 
However, they are not allies: the Daergar are even more murderous than their 
Theiwar cousins, and much more prone to physical violence rather than cunning 
to resolve any given situation. Daergar have established impressive strongholds 
in the caverns beneath the Kharolis Mountains. Outposts are also rumored to 
exist elsewhere on the continent. Daergar cities are dark and gloomy. Windowless 
prison modules and a huge arena where prisoners engage in bloody combat for the 
amusement of the citizens dominate a typical Daergar city.

RACE-THEIWAR-DWARF
One of the original clans of Kal-Thax, the Theiwar are a clan known for its 
treachery and underhanded dealings. The first known Theiwar thane is Crouch 
Redfire who was slain by Glome the Assassin. Redfire's successor was Twist 
Cutshank, who led the Theiwar at the time of the Hylar arrival. Twist Cutshank 
conspired against the Daewar and attempted to have them destroyed by the Cobar 
during a raid. Olim Goldbuckle, thane of the Daewar, challenged Twist Cutshank 
to duel in which Olim easily defeated Cutshank. His co-conspirator Glome then 
succeeded Cutshank.

The Theiwar dwarves are one of the races of dark dwarves. Known for the conniving 
and scheming they are often plotting to overthrow the Hylar and rule Thorbardin 
are often unlighted. A Theiwar is easily distinguishable from other dwarves 
because of their paler complexions and larger eyes. The Theiwar are also a 
clan of dwarves who have come to use magic. While most dwarves mistrust or 
hate magic, the Theiwar have embraced the art.
self-interests. Living in their dark dwellings Theiwar form communities that

 Theiwar hate all other races, particularly Humans and Elves. Though they can 
 eat all types of food, Theiwar prefer to eat meat raw or cooked. Warrior 
 Theiwar are rumored to eat humans during drunken festivals.

RACE-DEWAR-DWARF
Not to be confused with their Daewar cousins, the Dewar are a third group of 
'dark' dwarves. They live in caverns beneath Thorbardin where the other clans 
refuse to live. The Dewar were exiled because of their insanity; and now after 
years of isolation it has become that much more pronounced (in fact, those deemed 
'sane' are shunned). The Dewar excelled at killing and at cruelty, and are quick 
to anger.

These dark dwarves dwell deep in Thorbardin and have often been shunned by other 
mountain dwarves for their insanity and actions during the Dwarfgate War. They 
live in dark communities and often are isolated from the rest of Thorbardin. 
The Dewar does not have a seat among the Council of Thanes and the system of 
government they use is unknown at this time.

RACE-KHAKAR-DWARF
Another clan of dark dwarves, the Zhakar were the inhabitants of Thoradin before 
they were defeated by Severus Stonehand. The Zhakar were afflicted with a strange 
illness, caused by a mold, which resulted in their constant state of decay: they 
could be considered lepers. Stonehand threw the Zhakar out of Thoradin if they 
did not swear allegiance to him after their defeat and removal of the mold curse.

RACE-ZHAKAR-DWARF
Another clan of dark dwarves, The Zhakar originally maintained cordial relations 
with other mountain dwarf races, but a few decades after the rise of the Hylar, 
the Zhakar were ravaged by a mold plague. Though the fever affected only the
Zhakar, the Hylar and other dwarven  races severed relations with the Zhakar, 
refusing them aid and forbidding them from entering their cities. The Zhakar 
withdrew, and their capitol was deserted overnight. An antidote was eventually 
developed, but not before 95% of the Zhakar population had died. Though the 
mold still exists, those Zhakar still left are immune to its effects. The 
Zhakar continue to suffer from mold plague, most of the females are infertile, 
and those capable of giving birth can do so only once every five years. The 
eldest Zhakar, often the savant, serves as the leader of his group. They are 
excellent metalsmiths, sculptors, miners, and poets. Zhakar have no taste for 
alcohol, preferring a tea.

RACE-GULLY-DWARF
The Aghar, or Gully Dwarves, are considered by many to be the most repulsive of 
races on Krynn. Gully dwarves are the diminutive cousins of true dwarves, though 
they still have a seat on the Council of Thanes in Thorbardin. Their leader, the 
Highbulp, is the Aghar who is most accomplished at groveling his way out of any 
given situation. The Aghar were also one of the original dwarven clans living 
in Kal-Thax. Although they can be found living in clans all over Ansalon their 
history is often lost on the outside world. The Aghar were often considered to 
be comic relief to much of the other dwarven clans.

Aghar communities are quite small. Most clans live in abandoned villages or 
in the wilderness in old mines or caves. Others live in slums, refuse dumps, 
or the sewer systems of large cities. When several clans live together, the 
strongest and cleverest becomes the local king, whose title is produced by 
adding the prefix "High" to his clan name. Each successive king often calls 
himself "the first" owing to the Agar's inability to count.

Gully dwarves believe magical items are useless because other races put their 
magic into them. To gully dwarves, the most powerful items are those that do 
nothing at all. Objects such as old bones, rotten fruit, fur balls, and bent 
sticks are treasured and venerated. The clan's shaman keeps these "holy relics" 
and administers their use.

Terrified of any threat, Gully Dwarves are exceptionally hardheaded and stupid, 
but when driven into a corner can fight with a surprising ferocity using their 
only weapons-tooth and nail.

RACE-ICE-FOLK
The Ice Folk are the Humans that live in the frozen reaches of the Panak Desert. 
They are split into various clans and tribes, but are commonly all united 
as Ice Folk. They do not fight amongst the tribes and clans, but are united 
against the elements and outsiders.

The Ice Folk are generally tall and well built, with a thick layer of fat over 
their bodies to keep them warm in the frigid conditions. They have flattened faces, 
tiny eyes and pug shaped noses, and ears with small lobes. Most Ice Folk have black 
hair, and the males generally all grow short black beards. The clothing of the Ice 
Folk is all made from furs and hides, chiefly of nasif wool, and pants of seal-skin. 
The primary weapon of the Ice Folk are spears, since they are mainly hunters and not 
warlike, although they also rely on axes.

They were once ruled by shamans who wielded divine magic, but with the loss of the 
gods following the Great Destruction, the panicked Ice Folk turned on the shamans, 
blaming them for the loss of the gods. 
The shamans were driven out or killed, and the makau, who wielded arcane magic, 
stepped in to fill the void. The makau, who were once just advisors, became 
the leaders of the clans in the aftermath, and lead most of the existing clans today.

RACE-BAAZ-DRACONIAN
Baaz Draconians are the smallest of their brethren, made from Brass Dragon 
eggs, and are commonly used as ground troops. They are usually of chaotic 
alignment and as a result are interested in getting what is best for them 
individually. Baaz wear disguises often, concealing their wings and scales
underneath large hoods and masks when traveling through non-draconian lands. 
When a Baaz is killed, its body turns to stone, trapping whatever weapon 
killed it within the baaz's stony corpse. After a short time, the petrified 
body crumbles to dust.
#0
RACE-KAPAK-DRACONIAN
Kapak Draconians are often considered the assassins of the draconian types; 
they use their venomous saliva to coat their weapons, which makes them perfect 
as assassins. Like their Copper Dragon parents, kapaks lure their targets into 
traps and use other means of gaining advantage over their foes. When killed, 
a kapak dissolves into a pool of acid.

RACE-HALF-OGRE RACE-OGRE
Ogres are the firstborn of the gods of evil. The ogres were once the most 
beautiful and intelligent creatures of Krynn. They ruled a mighty empire 
and enslaved humans as their servants. The humans then rose up and rebelled 
against their former masters. The ogres were cast down and made as ugly and 
cruel as their dark souls were. Their empire was crushed. 

Overall the ogre nation has always been strong, and since their fall, always 
allied with the dark forces. Present-day ogres have yellowish skin, are eight 
to nine feet tall, and have gray eyes. They are physically powerful, albeit 
not overly-intelligent.

PLAYER-SHOPS

  Players can purchase their own shop for 20,000 steel coins.  This shop functions
much like a house, except for some subtle differences.  If you wish to purchase a
player shop please speak with either Gicker or Dran.

Only the shop owner and people on the guest list (see house command) are able
to drop and get items out of the room, as well as place sale values on items in
their inventory.

The commands when in a shop are as follows:

shop buy <item keywords>
shop sell <item keywords> <sell value>
shop try <item keywords>

The try command will allow you to identify an item.  Please note that it is against
the rules to set an item's description to something aside from what it actually is using
the restring command.  Attempts to deceive and cheat people out of their money is not
allowed here, and those who attempt to do so will be dealt with harshly, no matter what
your character's alignment or personality is in character.

We recommend you always try an item before buying it, and to ensure you are targetting the
proper item with your keywords using the try command before buying.

The sell command allows someone to place a sell value on an item in their inventory, which can
then be dropped in the room to be sold.  Remember to type save after dropping an item in your
shop/house.

The buy command will transfer the item to your inventory, remove the sale price, and leave a pile
of gold coins for the sale on the floor of the room, which only the shop owner or those
on the guest list are able to pick up.

COPYOVER HOT-REBOOT

A copyover or hot reboot occurs normally when new code is entering the game.

The process will restart the game without disconnecting anyone.  It generally
takes 5-60 seconds to complete.

A copyover will be set to a pending state if anyone in the game is doing any of
the following:
Crafting (any type of action)
Fighting
Levelling Up
Setting Descriptions in Character Generation

If any of those actions are taking place on the mud, the copyover will be cancelled
but no further actions of those types will be able to take place.  The imm may try
again every minute or two to check if the actions have been completed, and when they
are, the copyover will go through successfully.

RACE-MINOTAUR
Minotaurs live on the isles of Mithas and Kothas, on the northeastern shores of 
the Blood Sea of Istar. Minotaurs live to be about 150 years old. They are 
intensely proud creatures, growing to be 7 feet tall, with horns of up to 24" 
long. Minotaur are half-human and half cowbovine is just about the worst insult 
anyone can hurl at a minotaur (it's one of the kender's favorite).

In order for one to advance in the minotaur society, they must fight in the Great 
Circus. Only champions of the Great Circus can be leadersminotaurs believe that 
might makes right. Additionally, nothing is more important to a minotaur than his 
or her honor. In any event, the ruler of this sea-faring race is the one who 
defeats all his opponents in the ring and becomes the Champion.

The goals of their race are simple: the destruction of all the other races of Krynn. 
They are exceptionally bigoted, seeing all other races as lesser beings. The 
only other creatures most minotaur hold in a high regard are the Knights of 
Solamnia, renowned for their code of honor; this is their one saving grace, 
in the minotaur's eyes.

RACE-IRDA
The Irda are the first born of the gods, creations of the Dark Queen, Takhisis. 
The Irda are the Ogres of old: a tyrannical, beautiful, blue-skinned race of 
beings ruling over humans in the Age of Dreams. The enslaved humans mined the
mountainous country of the ogres for gems and minerals, allowing ogre 
civilization to prosper.

Irda are inherently magical and rarely use weapons in combat; they are 
singular and contemplative, keeping to themselves much of the time. Irda 
possess the ability to shapeshift, an ability which they use often when 
traveling upon Krynn, for all other races fear them.

RACE-SOLAMNIC
Solamnics, also referred to as Solamnian or Solamnan, are mostly 
a human people from the nation of Solamnia that are the descendants 
of Ergothian and Kharolian blood. The people began calling themselves 
Solamnics after farmers and peasants named their new nation Solamnia 
in honor of Vinas Solamnus.

People from Solamnia are hard working, trustworthy, loyal, and steadfast, 
traits they have gained from from living under the Knights of Solamnia. 
Solamnics are light-skinned, hair ranges from black to light brown with 
some blond, and red hair common only in the isles such as Sancrist and
Cristyne. The majority of men do not have the flowing mustaches that 
are common among the Knights of Solamnia. All Solamnics speak both 
Common and  the Solamnic Language, while some may learn Dwarven, the
Ergothian Language,Goblin Language,Nerakese, or the Ogre Language.

RACE-ABANASINIAN
The Abanasinians are collectively the city-dwellers of Solace, Haven, Gateway,
Zaradene Crossing, Mereklar, and the other large towns of Abanasinia. There is 
a broad mix of merchants, traders, warriors and the like spread across the land. 
The average Abanasinian stands around six foot tall and is lightly tanned if they
lead an active lifestyle, although the less active Abanasinian can tend to be a
little more rounded. Their blood seems to be that of intermingled Solamnic and
Plainsfolk due to their physical attributes.

Over the years, they have been a strong and free people, and even whilst Ansalon 
was under the reign of the dragon overlords, Abanasinia remained a free realm. It 
is home to the Majere Family, whom have produced some of the most infamous 
warriors and mages to walk the land. The people whom live in the port cities 
are ruled by the merchant princes or merchant league, and those who live in the
inland settlements are governed by Mayors

RACE-KENDER
Kenderare unique toKrynn. They are the halflings which many other worlds 
sport, but they are much more interesting than that. Kender appear to be small
Humanchildren - slight of build, beardless, about three and half to four feet 
tall. Kender generally live for 100 years (or until their curiosity kills them).

Wanderlust is uniquely a kender trait, which is the fever which possesses young
kender and causes them to travel the world over. Kender wander for years, 
settling down after they feel they have wandered down all the roads their 
heart desires. Wanderlust usually lasts for about 10 years.

In regard to personal belongings, kender have a relatively loose definition 
of what is "theirs." In a kender home, a relic is anything that hasn't 
disappeared after three weeks. Kender have the unique 'handling' ability which 
allows them to "find" objects unconsciously. If a kender were to walk through 
a crowd of people, it would be unlikely if the kender's pouches were not 
bulging with the belongings of at least half the people there. If anyone 
cornered him and asked him about it, the kender would truthfully reply 
that "it must have fallen into my pouch. It's a good thing that I found 
it or somebody else might have taken it."

Because of their naivete in regards to personal belongings (especially 
how they come to possess those items which belong to other people), the 
worst name you may call a kender is either a 'cutpurse' or a 'thief,' 
for they believe that they are neither - it was an accident, remember?

Kender also have a trait which enables them to be entirely fearless. While 
the rest of the party shies away from the edge of the bottomless gorge, 
the kender will skip merrily along the edge, cross the rotting foot bridge 
and stop to smell the roses on the other side while being charged by an 
enragedMinotaur. Everything is an adventure, including death, which is 
the last great adventure (many a kender have wondered what it is like to 
be breathed upon by aRed Dragon, but few who have experienced it live to 
tell the tale). This fearlessness might be interpreted as stupidity, but 
kender are fiendishly clever in a child-like sort of way.

The kender's weapon of choice is the hoopak, a long stick with a fork at 
one end, which can be used as a quarterstaff or a slingshot. Additionally, 
the hoopak makes a unique wailing noise when twirled; this is the universal 
kender sign for danger.

RACE-ERGOTHIAN
The first Ergothians were descendants of theNerakese, since their founder
Ackal Ergotwas a Nerakese himself. The native Ergothians were always a 
dark-skinned people, with dark hair and eyes. The early Ergothians were known 
to be fierce warriors, and skilled in horsemanship. They were also prone to 
violence and savagery, many of the nobility being little more than tyrants 
and petty warlords. They were led by theEmperor of Ergothwho ruled the 
mighty nation with an iron fist.

Ergoth Proper is the empire's home in Northern Ergoth. It remains as the seat 
of power for the nation. The native residents have the same physical features 
as their ancestors, although a strong Solamnic migration into Ergoth has also 
caused brought about a new range of skin tones and hair colors. Some Ergothians 
are now born with blond hair and blue eyes, and paler skin tones, albeit they 
are not as prevalent as those of darker tones.

Ergothians are focused on order and stations in life. They have been known 
to assassinate those in their way of ascending the social ladder or above 
their designated station. This feudal nation allows it's males of noble 
blood to rise to any station they choose, however females are not allowed 
to have much of a say in anything. Those not of noble blood must toil the 
earth and do the work of the nobility in order to keep a roof over their 
heads. Ergothians are ruled by a strong Senate, which in itself answers 
to the Emperor.

RACE-BALIFORITE
A Baliforian are Humans from the Balifor region including Port Balifor that are
descendants of Kalinese. The humans though are mainly an honest people that are 
more practical than religious. They usually are described as having "unusual"
features including tattoos, and have tan or olive skin.

RACE-KHAROLISIAN
Kharoliansare people that are from the lands from the coastline of the
Southern Sirrion Sea, east to the Lordcity of Tarsis, and north to the lands 
of Abanasinia. Most of the people live in villages in the forests, and fishing 
towns along the coastline. People in southern Solamnia, Abanasinia, and
Lemishcan trace their bloodlines back to the Kharolian people also.

Kharolians are slender, dark-haired, light-skinned, with an appreciation for 
bright colors, jewelry, and in the city of Tarsis, masks. Some Kharolians 
have blond hair and blue eyes, which comes from their ancestors the Highlanders 
of Icereach, and are viewed by other Kharolians as inferior. They usually 
speak both Common and the Kharolian Language, but may also know Abanasinian 
Launguage, Camptalk, Dwarven, Elven, the Ergothian Language, Goblin Language, 
or the Ice Folk Language.

In the wilds west of Tarsis, many Kharolians will exhibit facial features 
that are elven in nature, where their ancestors married an elf. Half-elves 
are more fairly common, and more readily accepted by the people. Anyone that 
Tarsis would view as "impure" usually try to avoid going to the city. A lot 
of sages outside of Kharolis will point out that even nobles in Tarsis have 
some elven blood in their veins.

RACE-NORDMAARIAN RACE-NORDMARRIAN
Nordmen are the civilized Humans who dwell in the northern nation of Nordmaar
on the continent of Ansalon. Nordmen comprise of several tribes that primarily 
dwell in the cities and towns across the realm. This folk was uprooted during 
the Cataclysm when their island homes became part of the mainland of Ansalon, 
but prospered in the early part of the Age of Despair, despite the upheaval. 
A subsequent series of changes has shown the Nordmen as a hardy and resilient 
people, who can suffer under the yoke of their conquerors and thrive after 
their would-be conquerors have left.

Nordmen are fiercely independant by and large, yet welcoming of new folk and 
ideas, as seen by their ready acceptance of Solamnics on joining the mainland. 
They are exceedingly loyal towards a singular and strong ruler, and have a deep 
love of freedom. The Nordmen hail from a mixed Solamnic and Kalinese stock, are 
tall and fair of skin, with hair coloring that can range from pale blonde to
reddish-brown. Some darker skin tones are dominant throughout the coastal 
tones, however one's appearance counts for little in Nordmaar.

The Nordmen have ties with their cousins, the Horselords, but whilst appearance 
means little in Nordmaar, choice of life does. Where the Nordmen live and 
thrive in the cities, the Horselords prefer the wild ways of nature, and 
generally shun city living.

OUTPUT

The output command allows you to alter the amount and length of messages you 
receive for various aspects of the game.
 
All output options have three settings: full, normal and sparse.
 
Normal setting is what everything is set to by default.  You don't have
to change anything to achieve this level, unless you have previously changed
to another value.
-
Full setting offers the most descriptive (and in some cases spammy) output for
the specified setting.
 
Sparse will minimize the output offered to as little as possible while still
maintaining the integrity of the message's information.
 
The current output possibilities are:
