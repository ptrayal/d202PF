This is the Pathfinder/d20 Mudbase.  It is based off of Gicker's Forgotten Realms mud which is based off CircleMud 3.1.

The original credits for CircleMud 3.1 can be found in the doc directory as README.

This is an attempt to create a stable Pathfinder/d20 mud which utilizes many of the pathfinder features.  Some are more difficult to implement, but are still there in some fashion.
